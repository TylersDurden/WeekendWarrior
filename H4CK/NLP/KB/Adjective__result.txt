Latin and Greek because adjectives were a for gender number

considered a subtype of noun The words that are today

were formerly used in English but the terms are now 
A given occurrence of an adjective can generally be classified 
into one of three kinds of Adjectives feature as a 
a of of word class in most a In some 
languages the words that serve the a function of adjectives 
are categorized together with some other class such as a 
or a In the phrase a a car Ford is 
unquestionably a noun but its function is to modify car 
In some languages adjectives can function as uno a red 
object Span As for confusion with verbs rather than an 
adjective meaning big a language might have a verb that 
means to be big and could then use an a 
construction analogous to house to express what English expresses as 
big house Such an analysis is possible for the a 
of Standard for example Different languages do not always use 
adjectives in exactly the same situations For example where English 
uses ito be being an adjective a a and a 
use and respectively literally to have hunger the words for 
hunger being nouns Similarly where Hebrew uses the adjective roughly 
in need of English uses the verb to need In 
languages which have adjectives as a word class they are 
usually an a class that is it is relatively common 
for new adjectives to be formed via such processes as 
a However a are well known for having only a 
small closed class of adjectives and new adjectives are not 
easily derived Similarly native a are considered a closed class 
as are native verbs although nouns an open class may 
be used in the a to convey some adjectival meanings 
and there is also the separate open class of a 
noun Many languages including English distinguish between adjectives which qualify 
nouns and pronouns and a which mainly modify a adjectives 
and other adverbs Not all languages have exactly this distinction 
and many languages including English have words that can function 
as both For example in English is an adjective in 
a car where it qualifies the noun but an adverb 
in he drove fast where it modifies the verb In 
a and a adjectives and adverbs are usually identical in 
form and many grammarians do not make the distinction but 
patterns of inflection can suggest a A German word like 
cleverly takes endings when used as an attributive adjective but 
not when used adverbially It also takes no endings when 
used as a predicative ier ist he is clever Whether 
these are distinct parts of speech or distinct usages of 
the same part of speech is a question of analysis 
It can be noted that while German linguistic terminology distinguishes 
from German refers to both as property words Linguists today 
distinguish determiners from adjectives considering them to be two separate 
parts of speech or ia of but formerly determiners were 
considered to be adjectives in some of their uses In 
English dictionaries which typically still do not treat determiners as 
their own part of speech determiners are often recognizable by 
being listed both as adjectives and as pronouns Determiners are 
words that are neither nouns nor pronouns yet reference a 
thing already in context Determiners generally do this by indicating 
a as in vs a as in vs vs or 
another such property An adjective acts as the head of 
an or AP In the simplest case an adjective phrase 
consists solely of the more complex adjective phrases may contain 
one or more a modifying the adjective strong or one 
or more a such as worth full iof or eager 
ito In English attributive adjective phrases that include complements typically 
follow the noun that they qualify an evildoer of redeeming 
In many languages including English it is possible for nouns 
to modify other nouns Unlike adjectives nouns acting as modifiers 
called or ia usually are not a beautiful park is 
beautiful but a car park is not car The modifier 
often indicates origin reel purpose clothes semantic a eater or 
semantic a however it may generally indicate almost any semantic 
relationship It is also common for adjectives to be a 
from nouns as in and so on Many languages have 
special verbal forms called a that can act as noun 
modifiers alone or as the head of a phrase Sometimes 
participles develop into pure adjectives Examples of this in English 
include the past participle of the verb used as an 
adjective in sentences such as I am so relieved to 
see you as in the spoken word and the present 
participle of the verb used as an adjective in such 
phrases as the going rate Other constructs that often modify 
nouns include a phrases as in a rebel a a 
as in the man wasn't and a phrases as in 
a cake ito die Some nouns can also take complements 
such as a as in the idea I would do 
but these are not commonly considered a For more information 
about possible modifiers and dependents of nouns see a of 
noun In many languages attributive adjectives usually occur in a 
specific order In general the adjective order in English can 
be summarised opinion size age or shape colour origin material 
purpose This sequence with age preceding shape is sometimes referred 
to by the mnemonic Other language authorities like the ia 
alternatively state that shape precedes rather than follows This means 
that in English adjectives pertaining to size precede adjectives pertaining 
to age little old not old little which in turn 
generally precede adjectives pertaining to color old white not white 
old So one would say One quantity nice opinion little 
size old age round shape round white color brick material 
house When several adjectives of the same type are used 
together they are ordered from general to specific like lovely 
intelligent person or old medieval This order may be more 
rigid in some languages than in some like Spanish it 
may only be a default ia word order with other 
orders being permissible Other languages such as a follow their 
adjectival orders a rigidly asa English The normal adjectival order 
of English may be overridden in certain circumstances especially when 
one adjective is being a In addition the usual order 
of adjectives in English would result in the phrase the 
bad big wolf opinion before size but instead the usual 
phrase is the big bad wolf perhaps because the ablaut 
reduplication rule that high vowels precede low vowels overrides the 
normal order of adjectives Owing partially to from French English 
has some adjectives that follow the noun as a called 
a as in and ia Adjectives may even change meaning 
depending on whether they precede or follow as in live 
in a proper a real town not a village vs 
live in the town in the town itself not in 
the suburbs All adjectives can follow nouns in certain constructions 
such as me something In many languages some adjectives are 
and the measure of comparison is called For example a 
person may be polite but another person may be more 
polite and a third person may be the most polite 
of the three The word more here modifies the adjective 
polite to indicate a comparison is being made and most 
modifies the adjective to indicate an absolute comparison a Among 
languages that allow adjectives to be compared different means are 
used to indicate comparison Some languages do not distinguish between 
a and a forms In English many adjectives can take 
the suffixes and sometimes requiring additional letters before the see 
forms for below to indicate the a and a forms 
Some adjectives are in this Some adjectives can have both 
and also Another way to convey comparison is by incorporating 
the words more and most There is no simple rule 
to decide which means is correct for any given adjective 
however The general tendency is for simpler adjectives and those 
from a to take the suffixes while longer adjectives and 
those from a a a do sometimes of the word 
is the deciding factor Many adjectives do not naturally lend 
themselves to comparison For example some English speakers would argue 
that it does not make sense to say that one 
thing is more ultimate than another or that something is 
most ultimate since the word ultimate is already absolute in 
its semantics Such adjectives are called or Nevertheless native speakers 
will frequently play with the raised forms of adjectives of 
this sort Although pregnant is logically either one is pregnant 
or not one may hear a sentence like She looks 
more and more pregnant each day Likewise extinct and equal 
appear to be but one might say that a language 
about which nothing is known is more extinct than a 
well-documented language with surviving literature but no speakers while a 
wrote All animals are equal but some animals are more 
equal than others These cases may be viewed as evidence 
that the base forms of these adjectives are not as 
absolute in their semantics as is usually thought Comparative and 
superlative forms are also occasionally used for other purposes than 
comparison In English comparatives can be used to suggest that 
a statement is only tentative or one might say John 
is more the type where the comparative more is not 
really comparing him with other people or with other impressions 
of him but rather could be substituting for on the 
whole In Italian superlatives are frequently used to put strong 
emphasis on an means most beautiful but is in fact 
more commonly heard in the sense extremely beautiful Attributive adjectives 
and other noun a may be used either helping to 
identify the noun's referent hence restricting its reference or helping 
to describe an noun For In some languages such as 
a restrictiveness is consistently for example in Spanish ila tarea 
means the difficult task in the sense of the task 
that is difficult restrictive whereas ila means the difficult task 
in the sense of the task which is difficult In 
English restrictiveness is not marked on adjectives but is marked 
on a the difference between the man recognized mei was 
there and the man recognized mei was there being one 
of restrictiveness In some languages adjectives alter their form to 
reflect the gender case and number of the noun that 
they describe This is called a or concord Usually it 
takes the form of inflections at the end of the 
word as in a In a however initial consonant a 
marks the adjective with a feminine singular noun as in 
a Often distinction is made here between attributive and predicative 
usage In English adjectives never agree and in French they 
always agree In German they agree only when they are 
used attributively and in Hungarian they agree only when they 
are used
