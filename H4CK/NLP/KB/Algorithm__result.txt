an a specification of how to solve a class of 
problems Algorithms can perform a a a and other tasks 
As an a an algorithm can be expressed within a 
finite amount of space and and in a well-defined formal 
for calculating a a Starting from an initial state and 
initial input perhaps a the instructions describe a a that 
when a proceeds through a number of well-defined successive states 
eventually producing and terminating at a final ending state The 
transition from one state to the next is not necessarily 
a some algorithms known as a incorporate random The concept 
of algorithm has existed for centuries a used algorithms in 
the a of of for finding prime numbers and the 
a for finding the a common common of two The 
word itself is derived from the 9th century mathematician a 
ibn Musa ibn Latinized A partial formalization of what would 
become the modern concept of algorithm began with attempts to 
solve the a decision problem posed by a in Later 
formalizations were framed as attempts to define a or effective 
Those formalizations included the a Cole a computer of and 
a a of a a of and a a of 
and The word has its roots in Latinizing the name 
of a ibn Musa ibn Musa in a first step 
to a span a span c was a a mathematician 
a a and scholar in the a of of in 
a whose name means native of a a region that 
was part of a and is now in a About 
wrote an a treatise on the a numeral numeral which 
was translated into a during the century under the title 
de numero This title means on the numbers of the 
Indians where was the translator's a of of was the 
most widely read mathematician in Europe in the late Middle 
Ages primarily through another of his books the a In 
late medieval Latin English the corruption of his name simply 
meant the decimal number system In the century under the 
influence of the Greek word the Latin word was altered 
to and the corresponding English term is first attested in 
the the modern sense was introduced in the In English 
it was first used in about and then by a 
in English adopted the French term but it wasn't until 
the late century that algorithm took on the meaning that 
it has in modern English Another early use of the 
word is from in a manual titled de composed by 
a of de It begins Haec ars praesens in qua 
bis quinque which translates Algorism is the art by which 
at present we use those Indian figures which number two 
times five The poem is a few hundred lines long 
and summarizes the art of calculating with the new style 
of Indian dice or or Hindu numerals An informal definition 
could be a set of rules that precisely defines a 
sequence of which would include all computer programs including programs 
that do not perform numeric calculations Generally a program is 
only an algorithm if it stops A prototypical example of 
an algorithm is the a to determine the maximum common 
divisor of two an example there are others is described 
by the a above and as an example in a 
later section a Jeffrey offer an informal meaning of the 
word in the following No human being can write fast 
enough or long enough or small and smaller without limit 
you'd be trying to write on molecules on atoms on 
electrons to list all members of an enumerably infinite set 
by writing out their names one after another in some 
notation But humans can do something equally useful in the 
case of certain enumerably infinite They can give instructions for 
determining the member of the seti for arbitrary finite Such 
instructions are to be given quite explicitly in a form 
in which could be followed by a computing or by 
a who is capable of carrying out only very elementary 
operations on An a infinite set is one whose elements 
can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the integers Thus 
and Jeffrey are saying that an algorithm implies instructions for 
a process that creates output integers from an input integer 
or integers that in theory can be arbitrarily large Thus 
an algorithm can be an algebraic equation such as iy 
m ni two arbitrary input variables imi and that produce 
an output But various attempts to define the notion indicate 
that the word implies much more than this something on 
the order of for the addition The concept of is 
also used to define the notion of a That notion 
is central for explaining how a come into being starting 
from a small set of a and rules In a 
the time that an algorithm requires to complete cannot be 
measured as it is not apparently related to our customary 
physical dimension From such uncertainties that characterize ongoing work stems 
the unavailability of a definition of that suits both concrete 
in some sense and abstract usage of the term Algorithms 
are essential to the way computers process data Many computer 
programs contain algorithms that detail the specific instructions a computer 
should perform in a specific order to carry out a 
specified task such as calculating paychecks or printing report cards 
Thus an algorithm can be considered to be any sequence 
of operations that can be simulated by a a system 
Authors who assert this thesis include Minsky Savage and Gurevich 
But we will also maintain with Turing that any procedure 
which could naturally be called effective can in fact be 
realized by a simple machine Although this may seem extreme 
the arguments in its favor are hard to informal argument 
in favor of his thesis justifies a stronger every algorithm 
can be simulated by a Turing machine according to Savage 
an algorithm is a computational process defined by a Turing 
Typically when an algorithm is associated with processing information data 
can be read from an input source written to an 
output device and stored for further processing Stored data are 
regarded as part of the internal state of the entity 
performing the algorithm In practice the state is stored in 
one or more a For some such computational process the 
algorithm must be rigorously specified in the way it applies 
in all possible circumstances that could arise That is any 
conditional steps must be systematically dealt with the criteria for 
each case must be clear and computable Because an algorithm 
is a precise list of precise steps the order of 
computation is always crucial to the functioning of the algorithm 
Instructions are usually assumed to be listed explicitly and are 
described as starting from the top and going down to 
the bottom an idea that is described more formally by 
ia of So far this discussion of the formalization of 
an algorithm has assumed the premises of a This is 
the most common conception and it attempts to describe a 
task in discrete mechanical means Unique to this conception of 
formalized algorithms is the a setting the value of a 
variable It derives from the intuition of a as a 
scratchpad There is an example below of such an assignment 
For some alternate conceptions of what constitutes an algorithm see 
a and a Algorithms can be expressed in many kinds 
of notation including a a a a a or a 
processed by a Natural language expressions of algorithms tend to 
be verbose and ambiguous and are rarely used for complex 
or technical algorithms flowcharts a and control tables are structured 
ways to express algorithms that avoid many of the ambiguities 
common in natural language statements Programming languages are primarily intended 
for expressing algorithms in a form that can be executed 
by a computer but are often used as a way 
to define or document algorithms There is a wide variety 
of representations possible and one can express a given a 
program as a sequence of machine tables see more at 
a a transition transition and a as flowcharts and a 
see more at a or as a form of rudimentary 
a or a called sets of quadruples see more at 
a Representations of algorithms can be classed into three accepted 
levels of Turing machine For an example of the simple 
algorithm Add described in all three levels see a Algorithm 
design refers to a method or mathematical process for and 
engineering algorithms The design of algorithms is part of many 
solution theories of a such as a and a and 
conquer Techniques for designing and implementing algorithm designs are also 
called algorithm design such as the template method pattern and 
decorator pattern One of the most important aspects of algorithm 
design is creating an algorithm that has an efficient also 
known as its a O Oa Typical steps in the 
development of Most algorithms are intended to be implemented as 
a However algorithms are also implemented by other means such 
as in a a neural neural for example the a 
implementing a or an insect looking for food in an 
a or in a mechanical device In a an algorithm 
is basically an instance of a written in software by 
software developers to be effective for the intended target computers 
to produce from given perhaps null An optimal algorithm even 
running in old hardware would produce faster results than a 
higher a algorithm for the same purpose running in more 
efficient that is why algorithms like computer hardware are considered 
technology compact programs good fast programs The notion of simplicity 
and elegance appears informally in a and precisely in a 
prefaces his definition I'll show you can't prove that a 
program is a proof would solve the a ibid versus 
function computable by an For a given function multiple algorithms 
may exist This is true even without expanding the available 
instruction set available to the programmer Rogers observes that It 
is important to distinguish between the notion of ie procedure 
and the notion of computable by ie mapping yielded by 
procedure The same function may have several different Unfortunately there 
may be a tradeoff between goodness speed and elegance elegant 
program may take more steps to complete a computation than 
one less elegant An example that uses algorithm appears below

type of machine a discrete deterministic mechanical that blindly follows

distinguishable ii discrete indistinguishable iii an agent and iv a 
list of instructions that are relative to the capability of

in his Very Simple Bases for a a proceeds sequentially 
through its five or six depending on how one counts 
instructions unless either a conditional GOTO or an unconditional GOTO 
changes program flow out of sequence Besides HALT machine includes 
three replacement ZERO eg the contents of location replaced by

must a programmer write code with such a limited instruction 
set But Minsky shows as do and that his machine 
is a with only four general of conditional GOTO unconditional 
GOTO and of an computer Knuth advises the reader that 
the best way to learn an algorithm is to try 
it immediately take pen and paper and work through an 
But what about a simulation or execution of the real 
The programmer must translate the algorithm into a language that 
the can execute Stone gives an example of when computing 
the roots of a quadratic equation the must know how 
to take a square root If they don't then the 
algorithm to be effective must provide a set of rules 
for extracting a square This means that the programmer must 
know a language that is effective relative to the target 
computing agent But what model should be used for the 
Van Boas observes even if we base a complexity on 
abstract instead of concrete machines arbitrariness of the choice of 
a model remains It is at this point that the 
notion of When speed is being measured the instruction set 
matters For example the subprogram in algorithm to compute the 
remainder would execute much faster if the programmer had a 
a instruction available rather than just subtraction or just decrement 
programming canonical Per the a any algorithm can be computed 
by a model known to be a and per demonstrations 
Turing completeness requires only four instruction GOTO unconditional GOTO assignment 
HALT Kemeny and Kurtz observe that while undisciplined use of 
unconditional GOTOs and conditional GOTOs can result in a a 
programmer can write structured programs using only these on the 
other hand it is also possible and not too hard 
to write badly structured programs in a structured augments the 
three a program canonical SEQUENCE and with two and An 
additional benefit of a structured program is that it lends 
itself to a of of using a flowchart The graphical 
aide called a a offers a way to describe and 
document an algorithm and a computer program of one Like 
the program flow of a Minsky machine a flowchart always 
starts at the top of a page and proceeds down 
Its primary symbols are only the directed arrow showing program 
flow the rectangle SEQUENCE GOTO the diamond and the dot 
The canonical structures are made of these primitive shapes can 
nest in rectangles but only if a single exit occurs 
from the superstructure The symbols and their use to build 
the canonical structures are shown in the diagram One of 
the simplest algorithms is to find the largest number in 
a list of numbers of random order Finding the solution 
requires looking at every number in the list From this 
follows a simple algorithm which can be stated in a 
high-level description in English prose a algorithm to compute the 
a common common GCD to two numbers appears as Proposition 
II in Book VII Elementary Number Theory of his ia 
Euclid poses the problem Given two numbers not prime to 
one another to find their greatest common measure He defines 
A number a multitude composed of a counting number a 
positive integer not including zero To measure is to place 
a shorter measuring length isi successively times along longer length 
until the remaining portion iri is less than the shorter 
length In modern words remainder iri being the quotient or 
remainder iri is the modulus the part left over after 
the For method to succeed the starting lengths must satisfy 
two i the lengths must not be zero AND ii 
the subtraction must be ie a test must guarantee that 
the smaller of the two numbers is subtracted from the 
larger alternately the two can be equal so their subtraction 
yields zero original proof adds a third the two lengths 
must not be prime to one another Euclid stipulated this 
so that he could construct a a ad ad proof 
that the two common measure is in fact the While 
algorithm is the same as when the numbers are prime 
to one another it yields the number for their common 
measure So to be precise the following is really algorithm 
Only a few instruction are required to execute logical tests 
conditional GOTO unconditional GOTO assignment replacement and subtraction The following 
algorithm is framed as version of and but rather than 
using division to find the remainder it uses successive subtractions 
of the shorter length isi from the remaining length iri 
until iri is less than isi The high-level description shown 
in boldface is adapted from Knuth iri Until the remaining 
length iri in R is less than the shorter length 
isi in S repeatedly subtract the measuring number isi in 
S from the remaining length iri in R the remainder 
EITHER i the last measure was exact the remainder in 
R is zero and the program can halt OR ii 
the algorithm must the last measure left a remainder in 
R less than measuring number in S isi and The 
nut of algorithm Use remainder iri to measure what was 
previously smaller number L serves as a temporary location span 
solid following version of algorithm requires only six core instructions 
to do what thirteen are required to do by worse 
Inelegant requires more of this text it is general consensus 
in software engineering that good programming style does not aim 
at minimizing the number of whatever that means instructions or 
instruction types Software engineers during the entire recent years would 
have ostracized the shown program if only due to its 
extensive use of While the program should not be removed 
here it could serve as an example of poor programming 
style leading to source code March The flowchart of Elegant 
can be found at the top of this article In 
the unstructured Basic language the steps are numbered and the 
instruction code span span span is the assignment instruction symbolized 
by Elegant In place of an outer Euclid loop Elegant 
shifts back and forth between two an A B loop 
that computes A A B and a B A loop 
that computes B B A This works because when at 
last the minuend M is less than or equal to 
the subtrahend S Difference Minuend Subtrahend the minuend can become 
isi the new measuring length and the subtrahend can become 
the new iri the length to be in other words 
the sense of the subtraction reverses The following version can 
be used with Object Oriented Does an algorithm do what 
its author wants it to A few test cases usually 
give some confidence in the core functionality But tests are 
not enough For test cases one uses and Knuth suggested 
Another interesting case is the two a numbers and But 
exceptional must be identified and tested Will Inelegant perform properly 
when R S S R R Ditto for B A 
A B A Yes to all What happens when one 
number is zero both numbers are Inelegant computes forever in 
all Elegant computes forever when A What happens if numbers 
are Fractional If the input numbers ie the a of 
the function computed by the is to include only positive 
integers including zero then the failures at zero indicate that 
the algorithm and the program that a computer it is 
a a rather than a a A notable failure due 
to exceptions is the a Flight Flight rocket failure June 
of program correctness by use of mathematical Knuth demonstrates the 
application of a to an extended version of algorithm and 
he proposes a general method applicable to proving the validity 
of any proposes that a measure of the complexity of 
a program be the length of its correctness compactness versus 
goodness With only six core instructions Elegant is the clear 
winner compared to Inelegant at thirteen instructions However Inelegant is 
it arrives at HALT in fewer steps a indicates why 
this is the Elegant does conditional tests in every subtraction 
loop whereas Inelegant only does one As the algorithm usually 
requires many ion much time is wasted doing a B 
test that is needed only after the remainder is computed 
iCan the algorithms be Once the programmer judges a program 
fit and is it computes the function intended by its 
the question becomes can it be The compactness of Inelegant 
can be improved by the elimination of five steps But 
proved that compacting an algorithm cannot be automated by a 
generalized rather it can only be done a ie by 
exhaustive search examples to be found at a trial and 
error cleverness insight application of a etc Observe that steps 
and are repeated in steps and Comparison with Elegant provides 
a hint that these steps together with steps 2 and 
can be eliminated This reduces the number of core instructions 
from thirteen to eight which makes it more elegant than 
Elegant at nine steps The speed of Elegant can be 
improved by moving the test outside of the two subtraction 
loops This change calls for the addition of three instructions 
B A GOTO Now Elegant computes the whether this is 
always the case for any given A B and R 
S would require a detailed analysis It is frequently important 
to know how much of a particular resource such as 
time or storage is theoretically required for a given algorithm 
Methods have been developed for the a of of to 
obtain such quantitative answers for example the sorting algorithm above 
has a time requirement of using the a O O 
with as the length of the list At all times 
the algorithm only needs to remember two the largest number 
found so far and its current position in the input 
list Therefore it is said to have a space requirement 
of if the space required to store the input numbers 
is not counted or if it is counted Different algorithms 
may complete the same task with a different set of 
instructions in less or more time space or than others 
For example a a algorithm with cost n outperforms a 
sequential search cost On when used for a on sorted 
lists or arrays The a of and study of is 
a discipline of a and is often practiced abstractly without 
the use of a specific a or implementation In this 
sense algorithm analysis resembles other mathematical disciplines in that it 
focuses on the underlying properties of the algorithm and not 
on the specifics of any particular implementation Usually a is 
used for analysis as it is the simplest and most 
general representation However ultimately most algorithms are usually implemented on 
particular platforms and their a is eventually put to the 
test using real code For the solution of a one 
off problem the efficiency of a particular algorithm may not 
have significant consequences unless n is extremely large but for 
algorithms designed for fast interactive commercial or long life scientific 
usage it may be critical Scaling from small n to 
large n frequently exposes inefficient algorithms that are otherwise benign 
Empirical testing is useful because it may uncover unexpected interactions 
that affect performance a may be used to compare potential 
improvements to an algorithm after program optimization To illustrate the 
potential improvements possible even in well-established algorithms a recent significant 
innovation relating to a Fourier algorithms used heavily in the 
field of image processing can decrease processing time up to 
times for applications like medical In general speed improvements depend 
on special properties of the problem which are very common 
in practical Speedups of this magnitude enable computing devices that 
make extensive use of image processing like digital cameras and 
medical equipment to consume less power There are various ways 
to classify algorithms each with its own merits One way 
to classify algorithms is by implementation means Another way of 
classifying algorithms is by their design methodology or a There 
is a certain number of paradigms each different from the 
other Furthermore each of these categories includes many different types 
of algorithms Some common paradigms For a there is a 
more specific classification of an algorithm for such problems may 
fall into one or more of the general categories described 
above as well as into one of the Every field 
of science has its own problems and needs efficient algorithms 
Related problems in one field are often studied together Some 
example classes are a a a a a a a 
geometric a a a a a algorithms and a Fields 
tend to overlap with each other and algorithm advances in 
one field may improve those of other sometimes completely unrelated 
fields For example dynamic programming was invented for optimization of 
resource consumption in industry but is now used in solving 
a broad range of problems in many fields Algorithms can 
be classified by the amount of time they need to 
complete compared to their input Some problems may have multiple 
algorithms of differing complexity while other problems might have no 
algorithms or no known efficient algorithms There are also mappings 
from some problems to other problems Owing to this it 
was found to be more suitable to classify the problems 
themselves instead of the algorithms into equivalence classes based on 
the complexity of the best possible algorithms for them The 
adjective continuous when applied to the word algorithm can Algorithms 
by themselves are not usually patentable In the United States

numbers or signals does not constitute processes USPTO and hence 
algorithms are not patentable as in a v v However 
practical applications of algorithms are sometimes patentable For example in 
a v v the application of a simple a algorithm
