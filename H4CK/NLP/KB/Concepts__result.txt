are mental representations abstract objects or abilities that make up 
the fundamental building blocks of a and a They play 
an important role in all aspects of a In a 
there are at least three prevailing ways to understand what 
a concept Concepts can be organized into a hierarchy higher 
levels of which are termed superordinate and lower levels termed 
subordinate Additionally there is the basic or middle level at 
which people will most readily categorize a For example a 
concept would be chair with its superordinate furniture and its 
subordinate easy chair A concept is a by all of 
its actual or potential instances whether these are things in 
the real world or other a Concepts are studied as 
components of human cognition in the a disciplines of a 
a and a where an ongoing debate asks whether all 
cognition must occur through concepts Concepts are used as formal 
tools or models in a a a and a where 
they are sometimes called a set a or a In 
a use the word often just means any a Within 
the framework of the a theory of theory of minda 
the structural position of concepts can be understood as Concepts 
serve as the building blocks of what are called colloquially 
understood as in the mindi Mental representations in turn are 
the building blocks of what are called colloquially understood as 
the stances or perspectives we take towards ideas be it 
believing doubting wondering accepting etc And these propositional attitudes in 
turn are the building blocks of our understanding of thoughts 
that populate everyday life as well as folk psychology In 
this way we have an analysis that ties our common 
everyday understanding of thoughts down to the scientific and philosophical 
understanding of A central question in the study of concepts 
is the question of what they Philosophers construe this question 
as one about the a of concepts what they are 
like The ontology of concepts determines the answer to other 
questions such as how to integrate concepts into a wider 
theory of the mind what functions are allowed or disallowed 
by a concept's ontology etc There are two main views 
of the ontology of Concepts are abstract objects and 2 
concepts are mental a views of the mind construe concepts 
as abstract There is debate as to the relationship between 
concepts and a However it is necessary at least to 
begin by understanding that the concept dog is philosophically distinct 
from the things in the world grouped by this concept 
or the reference class or a Concepts that can be 
equated to a single word are called lexical Study of 
concepts and conceptual structure falls into the disciplines of a 
a a and a In the simplest terms a concept 
is a name or label that regards or treats an 
abstraction as if it had concrete or material existence such 
as a person a place or a thing It may 
represent a natural object that exists in the real world 
like a tree an animal a stone etc It may 
also name an artificial man-made object like a chair computer 
house etc Abstract ideas and knowledge domains such as freedom 
equality science happiness etc are also symbolized by concepts It 
is important to realize that a concept is merely a 
symbol a representation of the abstraction The word is not 
to be mistaken for the thing For example the word 
moon a concept is not the large bright object up 
in the sky but only that celestial object Concepts are 
created named to describe explain and capture reality as it 
is known and understood a maintained the view that human 
minds possess pure or ia priori and a concepts Instead 
of being abstracted from individual perceptions like empirical concepts they 
originate in the mind itself He called these concepts a 
in the sense of the word that means a attribute 
characteristic or a But these pure categories are predicates of 
things iin not of a particular thing According to Kant 
there are twelve categories that constitute the understanding of phenomenal 
objects Each category is that one predicate which is common 
to multiple empirical concepts In order to explain how an 
ia concept can relate to individual phenomena in a manner 
analogous to an ia concept Kant employed the technical concept 
of the a He held that the account of the 
concept as an abstraction of experience is only partly correct 
He called those concepts that result from abstraction a posteriori 
concepts meaning concepts that arise out of experience An empirical 
or an ia concept is a general representation or thought 
of that which is common to several specific perceived objects 
a I Note A concept is a common feature or 
characteristic Kant investigated the way that empirical ia concepts are 
created The logical acts of the understanding by which concepts 
are generated as to their form In a abstract concepts 
are transformations of concrete concepts derived from embodied experience The 
mechanism of transformation is structural mapping in which properties of 
two or more source domains are selectively mapped onto a 
blended space Fauconnier Turner see a A common class of 
blends are a This theory contrasts with the rationalist view 
that concepts are perceptions or in a term of an 
independently existing world of ideas in that it denies the 
existence of any such realm It also contrasts with the 
empiricist view that concepts are abstract generalizations of individual experiences 
because the contingent and bodily experience is preserved in a 
concept and not abstracted away While the perspective is compatible 
with Jamesian pragmatism the notion of the transformation of embodied 
concepts through structural mapping makes a distinct contribution to the 
problem of concept claim needs references to reliable sources December 
a was the starkest proponent of the realist thesis of 
universal concepts By his view concepts and ideas in general 
are innate ideas that were instantiations of a transcendental world 
of pure forms that lay behind the veil of the 
physical world In this way universals were explained as transcendent 
objects Needless to say this form of realism was tied 
deeply with ontological projects This remark on Plato is not 
of merely historical interest For example the view that numbers 
are Platonic objects was revived by a as a result 
of certain puzzles that he took to arise from the 
phenomenological a founder of the analytic tradition in philosophy famously 
argued for the analysis of language in terms of sense 
and reference For him the sense of an expression in 
language describes a certain state of affairs in the world 
namely the way that some object is presented Since many 
commentators view the notion of sense as identical to the 
notion of concept and Frege regards senses as the linguistic 
representations of states of affairs in the world it seems 
to follow that we may understand concepts as the manner 
in which we grasp the world Accordingly concepts as senses 
have an ontological status According to a Benjamin Benjamin in 
the introduction to his History of the Calculus and its 
Conceptual concepts in calculus do not refer to perceptions As 
long as the concepts are useful and mutually compatible they 
are accepted on their own For example the concepts of 
the a and the a are not considered to refer 
to spatial or temporal perceptions of the external world of 
experience Neither are they related in any way to mysterious 
a in which quantities are on the verge of nascence 
or evanescence that is coming into or going out of 
existence The abstract concepts are now considered to be totally 
autonomous even though they originated from the process of abstracting 
or taking away qualities from perceptions until only the common 
essential attributes remained In a a a of of minda 
a concept is a mental representation which the brain uses 
to denote a class of things in the world This 
is to say that it is literally a symbol or 
group of symbols together made from the physical material of 
the Concepts are mental representations that allow us to draw 
appropriate inferences about the type of entities we encounter in 
our everyday Concepts do not encompass all mental representations but 
are merely a subset of The use of concepts is 
necessary to cognitive processes such as a a a a 
and a claim needs references to reliable sources December Concepts 
are thought to be stored in long term a in 
contrast to a of the particular objects and events which 
they abstract which are stored in a Evidence for this 
separation comes from hippocampal damaged patients such as a The 
abstraction from the day's hippocampal events and objects into cortical 
concepts is often considered to be the computation underlying some 
stages of sleep and dreaming Many people beginning with Aristotle 
report memories of dreams which appear to mix the day's 
events with analogous or related historical concepts and memories and 
suggest that they were being sorted or organised into more 
abstract concepts Sort is itself another word for concept and 
sorting thus means to organise into concepts The classical theory 
of concepts also referred to as the empiricist theory of 
is the oldest theory about the structure of concepts it 
can be traced back to and was prominently held until 
the The classical theory of concepts says that concepts have 
a definitional Adequate definitions of the kind required by this 
theory usually take the form of a list of features 
These features must have two important qualities to provide a 
comprehensive Features entailed by the definition of a concept must 
be both ia and and ia and for membership in 
the class of things covered by a particular A feature 
is considered necessary if every member of the denoted class 
has that feature A feature is considered sufficient if something 
has all the parts required by the For example the 
classic example ia is said to be defined by and 
ia An entity is a bachelor by this definition if 
and only if it is both unmarried and a man 
To check whether something is a member of the class 
you compare its qualities to the features in the Another 
key part of this theory is that it obeys the 
ia of the excluded of the excluded which means that 
there are no partial members of a class you are 
either in or The classical theory persisted for so long 
unquestioned because it seemed intuitively correct and has great explanatory 
power It can explain how concepts would be acquired how 
we use them to categorize and how we use the 
structure of a concept to determine its referent In fact 
for many years it was one of the major activities 
in a a concept Concept analysis is the act of 
trying to articulate the necessary and sufficient conditions for the 
membership in the referent class of a claim needs references 
to reliable sources December For example classic a Without Change 
page does not Without explored whether the concept of the 
flow of time can include flows where no changes take 
place though change is usually taken as a definition of 
time Given that most later theories of concepts were born 
out of the rejection of some or all of the 
classical it seems appropriate to give an account of what 
might be wrong with this theory In the century philosophers 
such as Wittgenstein and argued against the classical theory There 
are six primary summarized as Prototype theory came out of 
problems with the classical view of conceptual Prototype theory says 
that concepts specify properties that members of a class tend 
to possess rather than must a a a and a 
Posner are a few of the key proponents and creators 
of this Wittgenstein describes the relationship between members of a 
class as There are not necessarily any necessary conditions for 
membership a dog can still be a dog with only 
three This view is particularly supported by psychological experimental evidence 
for Participants willingly and consistently rate objects in categories like 
or as more or less typical of that It seems 
that our categories are fuzzy psychologically and so this structure 
has explanatory We can judge an item's membership to the 
referent class of a concept by comparing it to the 
typical member the most central member of the concept If 
it is similar enough in the relevant ways it will 
be cognitively admitted as a member of the relevant class 
of suggests that every category is represented by a central 
exemplar which embodies all or the maximum possible number of 
features of a given According to Lech and explain that 
categorization involves many areas of the brain some of these 
visual association areas prefrontal cortex basal ganglia and temporal lobe 
is a reaction to the previous two theories and develops 
them This theory postulates that categorization by concepts is something 
like scientific Concepts are not learned in isolation but rather 
are learned as a part of our experiences with the 
world around In this sense structure relies on their relationships 
to other concepts as mandated by a particular mental theory 
about the state of the How this is supposed to 
work is a little less clear than in the previous 
two theories but is still a prominent and notable This 
is supposed to explain some of the issues of ignorance 
and error that come up in prototype and classical theories 
as concepts that are structured around each other seem to 
account for errors such as whale as a fish this 
misconception came from an incorrect theory about what a whale 
is like combining with our theory of what a fish 
When we learn that a whale is not a fish 
we are recognizing that whales don't in fact fit the 
theory we had about what makes something a fish In 
this sense the of concepts is responding to some of 
the issues of prototype theory and classic According to the 
theory of a or sensing concepts activation of a concept 
may be the main mechanism responsible for creation of phenomenal 
experiences Therefore understanding how the brain processes concepts may be 
central to solving the mystery of how conscious experiences or 
a emerge within a physical system eg the sourness of 
the sour taste of This question is also known as 
the a problem of problem of Research on emerged from 
research on a where it was noted that a synesthetic 
experience requires first an activation of a concept of the 
Later research expanded these results into everyday There is a 
lot of discussion on the most effective theory in concepts 
Another theory is semantic pointers which use perceptual and motor 
representations and these representations are like The term concept is 
traced back to Latin ia something
