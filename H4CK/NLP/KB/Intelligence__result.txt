has been defined in many ways the capacity for a 
a a a a a a a a and a 
More generally it can be described as the ability to 
perceive or infer a and to retain it as a 
to be applied towards adaptive behaviors within an environment or 
context Intelligence is most often studied in humans but has 
also been observed in both animals and in plants Intelligence 
in machines is called a which is commonly implemented in 
a using a and sometimes appropriate a The word ia 
derives from the Latin a ia or ia which in 
turn stem from the verb ia to comprehend or perceive 
In the a the word became the scholarly technical term 
for understanding and a translation for the Greek philosophical term 
ia This term however was strongly linked to the a 
and a theories of a a including theories of the 
immortality of the soul and the concept of the a 
also known as the Active Intelligence This entire approach to 
the study of nature was strongly rejected by the a 
modern philosophers such as a a a and a all 
of whom preferred the word understanding in place of or 
intelligence in their English philosophical Hobbes for example in his 
Latin ia used translated in the English version as the 
understanding as a typical example of a logical a The 
term intelligence has therefore become less common in English language 
philosophy but it has later been taken up with the 
scholastic theories which it now implies in more contemporary a 
The a of intelligence is Some groups of a have 
suggested the following From a Science on Science on an 
a statement in the Wall Street Journal signed by fifty-two 
researchers out of total invited to A very general mental 
capability that among other things involves the ability to reason 
plan solve problems think abstractly comprehend complex ideas learn quickly 
and learn from experience It is not merely book learning 
a narrow academic skill or smarts Rather it reflects a 
broader and deeper capability for comprehending our on making sense 
of things or figuring out what to From ia Knowns 
and Knowns and a report published by the Board of 
Scientific Affairs of the a Psychological Psychological Individuals differ from 
one another in their ability to understand complex ideas to 
adapt effectively to the environment to learn from experience to 
engage in various forms of reasoning to overcome obstacles by 
taking thought Although these individual differences can be substantial they 
are never entirely a given person's intellectual performance will vary 
on different occasions in different domains as judged by different 
criteria Concepts of intelligence are attempts to clarify and organize 
this complex set of phenomena Although considerable clarity has been 
achieved in some areas no such conceptualization has yet answered 
all the important questions and none commands universal assent Indeed 
when two dozen prominent theorists were recently asked to define 
intelligence they gave two dozen somewhat different Besides those definitions 
a and a researchers also have suggested definitions of intelligence 
such Intelligence is a force F that acts so as 
to maximize future freedom of action It acts to maximize 
future freedom of action or keep options open with some 
strength T with the diversity of possible accessible futures S 
up to some future time horizon In short intelligence doesn't 
like to get trapped Human intelligence is the intellectual power 
of humans which is marked by complex a feats and 
high levels of a and a Intelligence enables humans to 
remember descriptions of things and use those descriptions in future 
behaviors It is a cognitive process It gives humans the 
a abilities to a a a and a including the 
capacities to a comprehend ideas a a and use a 
to a Intelligence enables humans to a and a Much 
of the above definition applies also to the intelligence of 
animals Although humans have been the primary focus of intelligence 
researchers scientists have also attempted to investigate animal intelligence or 
more broadly animal a These researchers are interested in studying 
both mental ability in a particular a and comparing abilities 
between species They study various measures of problem solving as 
well as numerical and verbal reasoning abilities Some challenges in 
this area are defining intelligence so that it has the 
same meaning across species eg comparing intelligence between literate humans 
and illiterate animals and also a a measure that accurately 
compares mental ability across different species and contexts a research 
on the intelligence of apes is an example of research 
in this area Stanley book ia Intelligence of Intelligence of 
is a notable book on the topic of dog See 
a animals particularly noted and studied for their intelligence include 
a a notably the a and other a a a 
and to some extent a a and a a also 
provides important comparative study a appear to exhibit characteristics of 
significant intelligence yet their a differ radically from those of 
backboned animals Vertebrates such as a a a and a 
have shown a fairly high degree of intellect that varies 
according to each species The same is true with a 
Evidence of a general factor of intelligence has been observed 
in animals The general factor of intelligence or a factor 
is a a construct that summarizes the correlations observed between 
an individual's scores on a wide range of a First 
described in a the factor has since been identified in 
a number of Cognitive ability and intelligence cannot be measured 
using the same largely verbally dependent scales developed for humans 
Instead intelligence is measured using a variety of interactive and 
observational tools focusing on a a reversal a learning and 
responses to a Studies have shown that is responsible for 
of the individual variance in cognitive ability measures in a 
and between and of the variance in a These values 
are similar to the accepted variance in a explained by 
in humans It has been argued that plants should also 
be classified as intelligent based on their ability to sense 
and model external and internal environments and adjust their a 
a and a accordingly to ensure self-preservation and A counter 
argument is that intelligence is commonly understood to involve the 
creation and use of persistent memories as opposed to computation 
that does not involve learning If this is accepted as 
definitive of intelligence then it includes the artificial intelligence of 
robots capable of machine learning but excludes those purely autonomic 
responses that can be observed in many plants Plants are 
not limited to automated responses however they are capable of 
discriminating positive and negative experiences and of learning registering memories 
from their past experiences They are also capable of communication 
accurately computing their circumstances using sophisticated a and taking tightly 
controlled actions to mitigate and control the diverse environmental Artificial 
intelligence or AI is both the intelligence of machines and 
the branch of a which aims to create it through 
the study and design of a or rational agents where 
an a is a system that perceives its environment and 
takes actions which maximize its chances of a and define 
artificial intelligence as ability to correctly interpret external data to 
learn from such data and to use those learnings to 
achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible a in artificial 
in artificial include constrained and well-defined problems such as games 
a and a character character and a few more general 
problems such as a General intelligence or a general AIa 
has not yet been achieved and is a long-term goal 
of AI research Among the traits that researchers hope machines 
will exhibit are a a a a a a and 
the ability to a and to manipulate In the field
