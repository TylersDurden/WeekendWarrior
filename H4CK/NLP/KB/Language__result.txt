and use of complex systems of a particularly the a 
ability to do and ba is any specific example of 
such a system The scientific study of language is called 
a Questions concerning the a of of such as whether 
words can represent experience have been debated at least since 
a and a in a Thinkers such as a have 
argued that language originated from a while others like a 
have held that it originated from rational and logical thought 
philosophers such as a argued that philosophy is really the 
study of language Major figures in linguistics include a de 
de Saussurea and a Estimates of the number of human 
languages in the world vary between and However any precise 
estimate depends on a partly arbitrary distinction between languages and 
a a are a or a but any language can 
be a into secondary media using auditory visual or tactile 
a for example in a a or a This is 
because human language is a Depending on a of regarding 
the definition of language and meaning when used as a 
general concept language may refer to the a ability to 
learn and use systems of complex communication or to describe 
the set of rules that makes up these systems or 
the set of utterances that can be produced from those 
rules All languages rely on the process of a to 
relate a to particular a a a and tactile languages 
contain a a system that governs how symbols are used 
to form sequences known as words or a and a 
a system that governs how words and morphemes are combined 
to form phrases and utterances Human language has the properties 
of a and a and relies entirely on social convention 
and learning Its complex structure affords a much wider range 
of expressions than any known system of a Language is 
thought to have originated when early a started gradually changing 
their primate communication systems acquiring the ability to form a 
a of of other and a shared a This development 
is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in 
brain volume and many linguists see the structures of language 
as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions 
Language is processed in many different locations in the a 
but especially in a and a Humans a language through 
social interaction in early childhood and children generally speak fluently 
by approximately three years old The use of language is 
deeply entrenched in human a Therefore in addition to its 
strictly communicative uses language also has many social and cultural 
uses such as signifying group a social a as well 
as a and a Languages a and diversify over time 
and the history of their evolution can be a by 
a method modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral 
languages must have had in order for the later developmental 
stages to occur A group of languages that descend from 
a common ancestor is known as a a The a

holds that between and of languages spoken at the beginning 
of the century will probably have become a by the 
year The English word derives ultimately from a language tongue 
speech language through a tongue and a ia The word

kinds of a constructed communication such as formally defined computer 
languages used for a Unlike conventional human languages a a 
in this sense is a a of a for a 
and decoding a This article specifically concerns the properties of 
a human as it is studied in the discipline of 
a As an object of linguistic study language has two 
primary an abstract concept and a specific linguistic system eg 
a The Swiss linguist a de de Saussurea who defined 
the modern discipline of linguistics first explicitly formulated the distinction 
using the French word for language as a concept ia 
and as a specific instance of a language system and 
for the concrete usage of speech in a particular When 
speaking of language as a general concept definitions can be 
used which stress different aspects of the These definitions also 
entail different approaches and understandings of language and they also 
inform different and often incompatible schools of linguistic Debates about 
the nature and origin of language go back to the 
ancient world Greek philosophers such as a and a debated 
the relation between words concepts and reality Gorgias argued that 
language could represent neither the objective experience nor human experience 
and that communication and truth were therefore impossible Plato maintained 
that communication is possible because language represents ideas and concepts 
that exist independently of and prior to During the a 
of and its debates about human origins it became fashionable 
to speculate about the origin of language Thinkers such as 
a and a Gottfried argued that language had originated in 
the instinctive expression of emotions and that it was originally 
closer to music and poetry than to the logical expression 
of rational thought Rationalist philosophers such as a and a 
held the opposite view Around the turn of the century 
thinkers began to wonder about the role of language in 
shaping our experiences of the asking whether language simply reflects 
the objective structure of the world or whether it creates 
concepts that it in turn imposes on our experience of 
the objective world This led to the question of whether 
philosophical problems are really firstly linguistic problems The resurgence of 
the view that language plays a significant role in the 
creation and circulation of concepts and that the study of 
philosophy is essentially the study of language is associated with 
what has been called the a and philosophers such as 
a in philosophy These debates about language in relation to 
meaning and reference cognition and consciousness remain active One definition 
sees language primarily as the a that allows humans to 
undertake linguistic to learn languages and to produce and understand 
utterances This definition stresses the universality of language to all 
humans and it emphasizes the biological basis for the human 
capacity for language as a unique development of the a 
Proponents of the view that the drive to language acquisition 
is innate in humans argue that this is supported by 
the fact that all cognitively normal children raised in an 
environment where language is accessible will acquire language without formal 
instruction Languages may even develop spontaneously in environments where people 
live or grow up together without a common for example 
a and spontaneously developed sign languages such as a Sign 
Sign This view which can be traced back to the 
philosophers Kant and Descartes understands language to be largely a 
for example in a theory of a or American philosopher 
a extreme theory These kinds of definitions are often applied 
in studies of language within a a framework and in 
a Another definition sees language as a a of signs 
governed by grammatical rules of combination to communicate meaning This 
definition stresses that human languages can be described as closed 
a consisting of rules that relate particular signs to particular 
This a view of language was first introduced by a 
de de and his structuralism remains foundational for many approaches 
to Some proponents of view of language have advocated a 
formal approach which studies language structure by identifying its basic 
elements and then by presenting a formal account of the 
rules according to which the elements combine in order to 
form words and sentences The main proponent of such a 
theory is a the originator of the a theory of 
who has defined language as the construction of sentences that 
can be generated using transformational Chomsky considers these rules to 
be an innate feature of the human mind and to 
constitute the rudiments of what language By way of contrast 
such transformational grammars are also commonly used to provide formal 
definitions of language are commonly used in a in a 
a of and in applied a In the philosophy of 
language the view of linguistic meaning as residing in the 
logical relations between propositions and reality was developed by philosophers 
such as a a and other a Yet another definition 
sees language as a system of communication that enables humans 
to exchange verbal or symbolic utterances This definition stresses the 
social functions of language and the fact that humans use 
it to express themselves and to manipulate objects in their 
environment a theories of theories of explain grammatical structures by 
their communicative functions and understand the grammatical structures of language 
to be the result of an adaptive process by which 
grammar was tailored to serve the communicative needs of its 
This view of language is associated with the study of 
language in a a and interactive frameworks as well as 
in a and a Functionalist theories tend to study grammar 
as dynamic phenomena as structures that are always in the 
process of changing as they are employed by their speakers 
This view places importance on the study of a or 
the classification of languages according to structural features as it 
can be shown that processes of a tend to follow 
trajectories that are partly dependent on In the philosophy of 
language the view of pragmatics as being central to language 
and meaning is often associated with a later works and 
with ordinary language philosophers such as a Austina a a 
and a van Orman A number of features many of 
which were described by a and called a design set 
human language apart from other known systems of communication such 
as those used by a Communication systems used by other 
animals such as a learning and or a ape are 
closed systems that consist of a finite usually very limited 
number of possible ideas that can be In contrast human 
language is open-ended and a meaning that it allows humans 
to produce a vast range of utterances from a finite 
set of elements and to create new words and sentences 
This is possible because human language is based on a 
dual code in which a finite number of elements which 
are meaningless in themselves eg sounds letters or gestures can 
be combined to form an infinite number of larger units 
of meaning words and However one study has demonstrated that 
an Australian bird the a is capable of using the 
same acoustic elements in different arrangements to create two functionally 
distinct Additionally a pied have demonstrated the ability to generate 
two functionally distinct vocalisations composed of the same sound type 
which can only be distinguished by the number of repeated 
Several species of animals have proved to be able to 
acquire forms of communication through social for instance a a 
named a learned to express itself using a set of 
symbolic a Similarly many species of birds and whales learn 
their songs by imitating other members of their species However 
while some animals may acquire large numbers of words and 
none have been able to learn as many different signs 
as are generally known by an average year old human 
nor have any acquired anything resembling the complex grammar of 
human Human languages also differ from animal communication systems in 
that they employ a and semantic such as noun and 
verb present and past which may be used to express 
exceedingly complex Human language is also unique in having the 
property of a for example a noun phrase can contain 
another noun phrase as in or a clause can contain 
another clause as in see dog is Human language is 
also the only known natural communication system whose adaptability may 
be referred to as This means that it can be 
used not only for communication through one channel or medium 
but through several For example spoken language uses the auditive 
modality whereas a and writing use the visual modality and 
a writing uses the tactile Human language is also unique 
in being able to refer to abstract concepts and to 
imagined or hypothetical events as well as events that took 
place in the past or may happen in the future 
This ability to refer to events that are not at 
the same time or place as the speech event is 
called ia and while some animal communication systems can use 
displacement such as the communication of a that can communicate 
the location of sources of nectar that are out of 
sight the degree to which it is used in human 
language is also considered Theories about the origin of language 
differ in regard to their basic assumptions about what language 
is Some theories are based on the idea that language 
is so complex that one cannot imagine it simply appearing 
from nothing in its final form but that it must 
have evolved from earlier systems among our ancestors These theories 
can be called theories The opposite viewpoint is that language 
is such a unique human trait that it cannot be 
compared to anything found among and that it must therefore 
have appeared suddenly in the transition from to early man 
These theories can be defined as Similarly theories based on 
the generative view of language pioneered by a see language 
mostly as an innate faculty that is largely genetically encoded 
whereas functionalist theories see it as a system that is 
largely cultural learned through social Chomsky is one prominent proponent 
of a theory of human language He suggests that for 
scholars interested in the nature of language talk about the 
evolution of the language capacity is beside the Chomsky proposes 
that perhaps some random mutation took place and it reorganized 
the brain implanting a language organ in an otherwise primate 
Though cautioning against taking this story literally Chomsky insists that 
it may be closer to reality than many other fairy 
tales that are told about evolutionary processes including Researchers on 
the evolutionary origin of language generally find it plausible to 
suggest that language was invented only once and that all 
modern spoken languages are thus in some way related even 
if that relation can no longer be because of limitations 
on the methods available for Because language emerged in the 
early a of man before the existence of any written 
records its early development has left no historical traces and 
it is believed that no comparable processes can be observed 
today Theories that stress continuity often look at animals to 
see if for example primates display any traits that can 
be seen as analogous to what language must have been 
like And early human fossils can be inspected for traces 
of physical adaptation to language use or forms of symbolic 
behaviour Among the signs in human fossils that may suggest 
linguistic abilities the size of the brain relative to body 
mass the presence of a a capable of advanced sound 
production and the nature of tools and other manufactured It 
was mostly undisputed that a did not have communication systems 
significantly different from those found in a in general However 
a study on a of challenges this Scholarly opinions vary 
as to the developments since the appearance of the genus 
ia some million years ago Some scholars assume the development 
of primitive systems as early as ia million years ago 
while others place the development of primitive symbolic communication only 
with ia million years ago or ia million years ago 
and the development of language proper with a modern Modern 
with the a Paleolithic less than years The study of 
language a has been developing into a science since the 
first grammatical descriptions of particular languages in a more than 
years ago after the development of the a Modern linguistics 
is a science that concerns itself with all aspects of 
language examining it from all of the theoretical viewpoints described 
The academic study of language is conducted within many different 
disciplinary areas and from different theoretical angles all of which 
inform modern approaches to linguistics For example a examines the 
grammar of single languages a develops theories on how best 
to conceptualize and define the nature of language based on 
data from the various extant human languages a studies how 
languages are used for social purposes informing in turn the 
study of the social functions of language and grammatical description 
a studies how language is processed in the human brain 
and allows the experimental testing of theories a builds on 
theoretical and descriptive linguistics to construct computational models of language 
often aimed at processing natural language or at testing linguistic 
hypotheses and a relies on grammatical and lexical descriptions of 
languages to trace their individual histories and reconstruct trees of 
language families by using the a The formal study of 
language is often considered to have started in a with 
a the 5th century BC grammarian who formulated rules of 
a a However a scribes already studied the differences between 
a and a grammar around BC Subsequent grammatical traditions developed 
in all of the ancient cultures that adopted In the 
century AD the French a developed the idea that the 
grammars of all languages were a reflection of the universal 
basics of thought and therefore that grammar was universal In 
the century the first use of the a by British 
a and expert on ancient India a Jones sparked the 
rise of a The scientific study of language was broadened 
from Indo-European to language in general by a von von 
Early in the century a de de Saussurea introduced the 
idea of language as a static system of interconnected units 
defined through the oppositions between By introducing a distinction between 
a and a analyses of language he laid the foundation 
of the modern discipline of linguistics Saussure also introduced several 
basic dimensions of linguistic analysis that are still fundamental in 
many contemporary linguistic theories such as the distinctions between a 
and a and the a and distinguishing language as an 
abstract system from language as a concrete manifestation of this 
system In the a formulated the a theory of According 
to this theory the most basic form of language is 
a set of syntactic rules that is universal for all 
humans and which underlies the grammars of all human languages 
This set of rules is called a for Chomsky describing 
it is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics 
Thus he considered that the grammars of individual languages are 
only of importance to linguistics insofar as they allow us 
to deduce the universal underlying rules from which the observable 
linguistic variability is In opposition to the formal theories of 
the generative school a theories of theories of propose that 
since language is fundamentally a tool its structures are best 
analyzed and understood by reference to their functions a theories 
of seek to define the different elements of language and 
describe the way they relate to each other as systems 
of formal rules or operations while functional theories seek to 
define the functions performed by language and then relate them 
to the linguistic elements that carry them The framework of 
a interprets language in terms of the concepts which are 
sometimes universal and sometimes specific to a particular language which 
underlie its forms Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how 
the mind creates meaning through Speaking is the default modality 
for language in all cultures The production of spoken language 
depends on sophisticated capacities for controlling the lips tongue and 
other components of the vocal apparatus the ability to acoustically 
decode speech sounds and the neurological apparatus required for acquiring 
and producing The study of the a bases for human 
language is at an early the only gene that has 
definitely been implicated in language production is a which may 
cause a kind of a verbal language if affected by 
a The brain is the coordinating center of all linguistic 
it controls both the production of linguistic cognition and of 
meaning and the mechanics of speech production Nonetheless our knowledge 
of the neurological bases for language is quite limited though 
it has advanced considerably with the use of modern imaging 
techniques The discipline of linguistics dedicated to studying the neurological 
aspects of language is called a Early work in involved 
the study of language in people with brain lesions to 
see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech 
In this way in the century discovered that two areas 
in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing The 
first area is a which is in the posterior section 
of the a temporal temporal in the dominant cerebral hemisphere 
People with a lesion in this area of the brain 
develop a a condition in which there is a major 
impairment of language comprehension while speech retains a rhythm and 
a relatively normal a The second area is a in 
the posterior a frontal frontal of the dominant hemisphere People 
with a lesion to this area develop a meaning that 
they know what they want to say they just cannot 
get it They are typically able to understand what is 
being said to them but unable to speak fluently Other 
symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems 
with fluency articulation a and producing and comprehending complex grammatical 
sentences both orally and in writing Those with this aphasia 
also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic 
information to determine the meaning of sentences Both expressive and 
receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language in 
analogous ways to how they affect speech with expressive aphasia 
causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar whereas 
a signer with receptive aphasia will sign fluently but make 
little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending signs This 
shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to 
use language not to the physiology used for speech With 
technological advances in the late century have also incorporated techniques 
such as a magnetic resonance magnetic resonance and a to 
study language processing in individuals without Spoken language relies on 
human physical ability to produce a which is a longitudinal 
wave propagated through the air at a frequency capable of 
vibrating the a This ability depends on the physiology of 
the human speech organs These organs consist of the lungs 
the voice box a and the upper vocal the throat 
the mouth and the nose By controlling the different parts 
of the speech apparatus the airstream can be manipulated to 
produce different speech The sound of speech can be analyzed 
into a combination of a and elements The segmental elements 
are those that follow each other in sequences which are 
usually represented by distinct letters in alphabetic scripts such as 
the Roman script In free flowing speech there are no 
clear boundaries between one segment and the next nor usually 
are there any audible pauses between words Segments therefore are 
distinguished by their distinct sounds which are a result of 
their different articulations and they can be either vowels or 
consonants Suprasegmental phenomena encompass such elements as a a type 
voice a and a or a all of which may 
have effects across multiple a and a segments combine to 
form a which in turn combine to form these can 
be distinguished phonetically as the space between two inhalations a 
these different segments are characterized by different a structures that 
are visible in a a of the recorded sound wave 
See illustration of Spectrogram of the formant structures of three 
English vowels Formants are the amplitude peaks in the frequency 
spectrum of a specific Vowels are those sounds that have 
no audible friction caused by the narrowing or obstruction of 
some part of the upper vocal tract They vary in 
quality according to the degree of lip aperture and the 
placement of the tongue within the oral Vowels are called 
ia when the lips are relatively closed as in the 
pronunciation of the vowel span in the International Phonetic Alphabet 
IPA English ee or ia when the lips are relatively 
open as in the vowel span in the International Phonetic 
Alphabet IPA English ah If the tongue is located towards 
the back of the mouth the quality changes creating vowels 
such as span in the International Phonetic Alphabet IPA English 
oo The quality also changes depending on whether the lips 
are a as opposed to unrounded creating distinctions such as 
that between span in the International Phonetic Alphabet IPA unrounded 
front vowel such as English ee and span in the 
International Phonetic Alphabet IPA a front front such as German 
Consonants are those sounds that have audible friction or closure 
at some point within the upper vocal tract Consonant sounds 
vary by place of articulation ie the place in the 
vocal tract where the airflow is obstructed commonly at the 
lips teeth a a a a or a Each place 
of articulation produces a different set of consonant sounds which 
are further distinguished by a of of or the kind 
of friction whether full closure in which case the consonant 
is called ia or ia or different degrees of aperture 
creating ia and ia Consonants can also be either ia 
or depending on whether the vocal cords are set in 
vibration by airflow during the production of the sound Voicing 
is what separates English span in the International Phonetic Alphabet 
IPA in a from span in the International Phonetic Alphabet 
IPA in a alveolar Some speech sounds both vowels and 
consonants involve release of air flow through the nasal cavity 
and these are called ia or ia sounds Other sounds 
are defined by the way the tongue moves within the 
such as the called ia because the air flows along 
both sides of the tongue and the called ia that 
are characterized by how the tongue is positioned relative to 
the air By using these speech organs humans can produce 
hundreds of distinct some appear very often in the world's 
languages whereas others are much more common in certain language 
families language areas or even specific to a single When 
described as a system of a language is traditionally seen 
as consisting of three a a and a a connecting 
signs with their meanings The study of the process of 
a how signs and meanings are combined used and interpreted 
is called a Signs can be composed of sounds gestures 
letters or symbols depending on whether the language is spoken 
signed or written and they can be combined into complex 
signs such as words and phrases When used in communication 
a sign is encoded and transmitted by a sender through 
a channel to a receiver who decodes Some of the 
properties that define human language as opposed to other communication 
systems the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign meaning that there 
is no predictable connection between a linguistic sign and its 
the duality of the linguistic system meaning that linguistic structures 
are built by combining elements into larger structures that can 
be seen as layered eg how sounds build words and 
words build the discreteness of the elements of language meaning 
that the elements out of which linguistic signs are constructed 
are discrete units eg sounds and words that can be 
distinguished from each other and rearranged in different and the 
productivity of the linguistic system meaning that the finite number 
of linguistic elements can be combined into a theoretically infinite 
number of The rules by which signs can be combined 
to form words and phrases are called a or grammar 
The meaning that is connected to individual signs morphemes words 
phrases and texts is called a The division of language 
into separate but connected systems of sign and meaning goes 
back to the first linguistic studies of de Saussure and 
is now used in almost all branches of Languages express 
meaning by relating a sign form to a meaning or 
its content Sign forms must be something that can be 
perceived for example in sounds images or gestures and then 
related to a specific meaning by social convention Because the 
basic relation of meaning for most linguistic signs is based 
on social convention linguistic signs can be considered arbitrary in 
the sense that the convention is established socially and historically 
rather than by means of a natural relation between a 
specific sign form and its meaning Thus languages must have 
a a of signs related to specific meaning The English 
sign dog denotes for example a member of the species 
ia In a language the array of arbitrary signs connected 
to specific meanings is called the a and a single 
sign connected to a meaning is called a a Not 
all meanings in a language are represented by single words 
Often semantic concepts are embedded in the morphology or syntax 
of the language in the form of a All languages 
contain the semantic structure of a a structure that predicates 
a property state or action Traditionally semantics has been understood 
to be the study of how speakers and interpreters assign 
a to statements so that meaning is understood to be 
the process by which a predicate can be said to 
be true or about an entity eg or Recently this 
model of semantics has been complemented with more dynamic models 
of meaning that incorporate shared knowledge about the context in 
which a sign is interpreted into the production of meaning 
Such models of meaning are explored in the field of 
a Depending on modality language structure can be based on 
systems of sounds speech gestures sign languages or graphic or 
tactile symbols writing The ways in which languages use sounds 
or signs to construct meaning are studied in a The 
study of how humans produce and perceive vocal sounds is 
called a In spoken language meaning is produced when sounds 
become part of a system in which some sounds can 
contribute to expressing meaning and others do not In any 
given language only a limited number of the many distinct 
sounds that can be created by the human vocal apparatus 
contribute to constructing Sounds as part of a linguistic system 
are called a Phonemes are abstract units of sound defined 
as the smallest units in a language that can serve 
to distinguish between the meaning of a pair of minimally 
different words a so-called a In English for example the 
words span in the International Phonetic Alphabet IPA and span 
in the International Phonetic Alphabet IPA form a minimal pair 
in which the distinction between span in the International Phonetic 
Alphabet IPA and span in the International Phonetic Alphabet IPA 
differentiates the two words which have different meanings However each 
language contrasts sounds in different ways For example in a 
language that does not distinguish between voiced and unvoiced consonants 
the sounds span in the International Phonetic Alphabet IPA and 
span in the International Phonetic Alphabet IPA if they both 
occur could be considered a single phoneme and consequently the 
two pronunciations would have the same meaning Similarly the English 
language does not distinguish phonemically between a and pronunciations of 
consonants as many other languages like a and a the 
unaspirated span in the International Phonetic Alphabet IPA in span 
in the International Phonetic Alphabet IPA and the aspirated span 
in the International Phonetic Alphabet IPA in span in the 
International Phonetic Alphabet IPA are considered to be merely different 
ways of pronouncing the same phoneme such variants of a 
single phoneme are called a whereas in a the same 
difference in pronunciation distinguishes between the words span in the 
International Phonetic Alphabet IPA and span in the International Phonetic 
Alphabet IPA the accent above the means that the vowel 
is pronounced with a high All a have phonemes of 
at least two different categories a and a that can 
be combined to form a As well as segments such 
as consonants and vowels some languages also use sound in 
other ways to convey meaning Many languages for example use 
a a a and a to distinguish meaning Because these 
phenomena operate outside of the level of single segments they 
are called a Some languages have only a few phonemes 
for example a and a with and phonemes respectively whereas 
languages like a may have as many as In a 
a equivalent to formerly called a are defined by the 
basic elements of gestures such as hand shape orientation location 
and motion which correspond to manners of articulation in spoken 
a represent language using visual symbols which may or may 
not correspond to the sounds of spoken language The a 
and those on which it is based or that have 
been derived from it was originally based on the representation 
of single sounds so that words were constructed from letters 
that generally denote a single consonant or vowel in the 
structure of the word In syllabic scripts such as the 
a syllabary each sign represents a whole syllable In a 
scripts each sign represents an entire and will generally bear 
no relation to the sound of that word in spoken 
language Because all languages have a very large number of 
words no purely logographic scripts are known to exist Written 
language represents the way spoken sounds and words follow one 
after another by arranging symbols according to a pattern that 
follows a certain direction The direction used in a writing 
system is entirely arbitrary and established by convention Some writing 
systems use the horizontal axis left to right as the 
Latin script or right to left as the a while 
others such as traditional Chinese writing use the vertical dimension 
from top to bottom A few writing systems use opposite 
directions for alternating lines and others such as the ancient 
Maya script can be written in either direction and rely 
on graphic cues to show the reader the direction of 
In order to represent the sounds of the world's languages 
in writing linguists have developed the a Phonetic Phonetic designed 
to represent all of the discrete sounds that are known 
to contribute to meaning in human Grammar is the study 
of how meaningful elements called ia within a language can 
be combined into utterances Morphemes can either be or If 
they are free to be moved around within an utterance 
they are usually called ia and if they are bound 
to other words or morphemes they are called a The 
way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a 
language is governed by rules The rules for the internal 
structure of words are called a The rules of the 
internal structure of phrases and sentences are called Grammar can 
be described as a system of categories and a set 
of rules that determine how categories combine to form different 
aspects of Languages differ widely in whether they are encoded 
through the use of categories or lexical units However several 
categories are so common as to be nearly universal Such 
universal categories include the encoding of the grammatical relations of 
participants and predicates by grammatically a between their to a 
predicate the encoding of a and a and relations on 
predicates and a system of a persona governing reference to 
and distinction between speakers and addressees and those about whom 
they are Languages organize their a of of into classes 
according to their functions and positions relative to other parts 
All languages for instance make a basic distinction between a 
group of words that prototypically denotes things and concepts and 
a group of words that prototypically denotes actions and events 
The first group which includes English words such as dog 
and song are usually called a The second which includes 
run and sing are called a Another common category is 
the a words that describe properties or qualities of nouns 
such as red or big Word classes can be open 
if new words can continuously be added to the class 
or relatively closed if there is a fixed number of 
words in a class In English the class of pronouns 
is closed whereas the class of adjectives is open since 
an infinite number of adjectives can be constructed from verbs 
eg saddened or nouns eg with the suffix as in 
In other languages such as a the situation is the 
opposite and new pronouns can be constructed whereas the number 
of adjectives is Word classes also carry out differing functions 
in grammar Prototypically verbs are used to construct a while 
nouns are used as a of predicates In a sentence 
such as Sally runs the predicate is runs because it 
is the word that predicates a specific state about its 
argument Sally Some verbs such as curse can take two 
arguments eg Sally cursed John A predicate that can only 
take a single argument is called a while a predicate 
that can take two arguments is called a Many other 
word classes exist in different languages such as a like 
and that serve to join two sentences a that introduce 
a noun a such as or a like splash that 
mimic the sound of some event Some languages have that 
describe the spatial position of an event or entity Many 
languages have a that identify countable nouns as belonging to 
a particular type or having a particular shape For instance 
in a the general noun classifier for humans is and 
it is used for counting humans whatever they are For 
trees it would In linguistics the study of the internal 
structure of complex words and the processes by which words 
are formed is called a In most languages it is 
possible to construct complex words that are built of several 
a For instance the English word unexpected can be analyzed 
as being composed of the three morphemes un- expect and 
Morphemes can be classified according to whether they are independent 
morphemes so-called a or whether they can only attached to 
other morphemes These bound morphemes or a can be classified 
according to their position in relation to the ia precede 
the root a follow the root and a are inserted 
in the middle of a root Affixes serve to modify 
or elaborate the meaning of the root Some languages change 
the meaning of words by changing the phonological structure of 
a word for example the English word run which in 
the past tense is ran This process is called ia 
Furthermore morphology distinguishes between the process of a which modifies 
or elaborates on a word and the process of a 
which creates a new word from an existing one In 
English the verb sing has the inflectional forms singing and 
sung which are both verbs and the derivational form singer 
which is a noun derived from the verb with the 
agentive suffix Languages differ widely in how much they rely 
on morphological processes of word formation In some languages for 
example Chinese there are no morphological processes and all grammatical 
information is encoded syntactically by forming strings of single words 
This type of is often called a or analytic because 
there is almost a full correspondence between a single word 
and a single aspect of meaning Most languages have words 
consisting of several morphemes but they vary in the degree 
to which morphemes are discrete units In many languages notably 
in most Indo-European languages single morphemes may have several distinct 
meanings that cannot be analyzed into smaller segments For example 
in Latin the word or good consists of the root 
meaning good and the suffix which indicates masculine gender singular 
number and a case These languages are called ia because 
several meanings may be fused into a single morpheme The 
opposite of fusional languages are a which construct words by 
stringing morphemes together in chains but with each morpheme as 
a discrete semantic unit An example of such a language 
is a where for example the word or from your 
houses consists of the morphemes with the meanings The languages 
that rely on morphology to the greatest extent are traditionally 
called a They may express the equivalent of an entire 
English sentence in a single word For example in a 
the single word means iI didn't understand consisting of morphemes 
with the meanings As another example with more complexity in 
the a word which means He had not yet said 
again that he was going to hunt reindeer the word 
consists of the morphemes with the meanings and except for 
the morpheme reindeer none of the other morphemes can appear 
in Many languages use morphology to cross-reference words within a 
sentence This is sometimes called ia For example in many 
Indo-European languages adjectives must cross-reference the noun they modify in 
terms of number case and gender so that the Latin 
adjective or good is inflected to agree with a noun 
that is masculine gender singular number and nominative case In 
many polysynthetic languages verbs cross-reference their subjects and objects In 
these types of languages a single verb may include information 
that would require an entire sentence in English For example 
in the a phrase or you saw me the past 
tense auxiliary verb similar to English do agrees with both 
the subject you expressed by the prefix and with the 
object me expressed by the suffix The sentence could be 
directly transliterated as see Another way in which languages convey 
meaning is through the order of words within a sentence 
The grammatical rules for how to produce new sentences from 
words that are already known is called syntax The syntactical 
rules of a language determine why a sentence in English 
such as I love you is meaningful but you I 
is Syntactical rules determine how word order and sentence structure 
is constrained and how those constraints contribute to For example 
in English the two sentences the slaves were cursing the 
master and the master was cursing the slaves mean different 
things because the role of the grammatical subject is encoded 
by the noun being in front of the verb and 
the role of object is encoded by the noun appearing 
after the verb Conversely in a both servos and mean 
the master was reprimanding the slaves because or slaves is 
in the a showing that they are the a of 
the sentence and or master is in the a showing 
that he is the Latin uses morphology to express the 
distinction between subject and object whereas English uses word order 
Another example of how syntactic rules contribute to meaning is 
the rule of a word order in which exists in 
many languages This rule explains why when in English the 
phrase John is talking to Lucy is turned into a 
question it becomes Who is John talking and not John 
is talking to The latter example may be used as 
a way of placing a on who thereby slightly altering 
the meaning of the question Syntax also includes the rules 
for how complex sentences are structured by grouping words together 
in units called a that can occupy different places in 
a larger syntactic structure Sentences can be described as consisting 
of phrases connected in a tree structure connecting the phrases 
to each other at different To the right is a 
graphic representation of the syntactic analysis of the English sentence 
the cat sat on the mat The sentence is analyzed 
as being constituted by a noun phrase a verb and 
a prepositional the prepositional phrase is further divided into a 
preposition and a noun phrase and the noun phrases consist 
of an article and a The reason sentences can be 
seen as being composed of phrases is because each phrase 
would be moved around as a single element if syntactic 
operations were carried out For example the cat is one 
phrase and on the mat is another because they would 
be treated as single units if a decision was made 
to emphasize the location by moving forward the prepositional on 
the mat the cat There are many different formalist and 
functionalist frameworks that propose theories for describing syntactic structures based 
on different assumptions about what language is and how it 
should be described Each of them would analyze a sentence 
such as this in a different Languages can be classified 
in relation to their grammatical types Languages that belong to 
different families nonetheless often have features in common and these 
shared features tend to For example languages can be classified 
on the basis of their basic a the relative order 
of the a and its constituents in a normal indicative 
a In English the basic order is a The snakeS 
the manO whereas for example the corresponding sentence in the 
a Aboriginal a would be snake man bit a Word 
order type is relevant as a typological parameter because basic 
word order type corresponds with other syntactic parameters such as 
the relative order of nouns and adjectives or of the 
use of a or a Such correlations are called a 
For example most but not all languages that are of 
the a type have rather than prepositions and have adjectives 
before All languages structure sentences into Subject Verb and Object 
but languages differ in the way they classify the relations 
between actors and actions English uses the a word in 
English transitive clauses the subjects of both intransitive sentences I 
run and transitive sentences I love you are treated in 
the same way shown here by the nominative pronoun iIi 
Some languages called a among them distinguish instead between Agents 
and Patients In ergative languages the single participant in an 
intransitive sentence such as I run is treated the same 
as the patient in a transitive sentence giving the equivalent 
of me run Only in transitive sentences would the equivalent 
of the pronoun I be In this way the semantic 
roles can map onto the grammatical relations in different ways 
grouping an intransitive subject either with Agents accusative type or 
Patients ergative type or even making each of the three 
roles differently which is called the a The shared features 
of languages which belong to the same typological class type 
may have arisen completely independently Their co-occurrence might be due 
to universal laws governing the structure of natural languages language 
universals or they might be the result of languages evolving 
convergent solutions to the recurring communicative problems that humans use 
language to While humans have the ability to learn any 
language they only do so if they grow up in 
an environment in which language exists and is used by 
others Language is therefore dependent on a of in which 
children a from their elders and peers and themselves transmit 
language to their own children Languages are used by those 
who speak them to a and to solve a plethora 
of social tasks Many aspects of language use can be 
seen to be adapted specifically to these Due to the 
way in which language is transmitted between generations and within 
communities language perpetually changes diversifying into new languages or converging 
due to a The process is similar to the process 
of a where the process of descent with modification leads 
to the formation of a a However languages differ from 
biological organisms in that they readily incorporate elements from other 
languages through the process of a as speakers of different 
languages come into contact Humans also frequently speak more than 
one language acquiring their a or languages as children or 
learning new languages as they grow up Because of the 
increased language contact in the globalizing world many small languages 
are becoming a as their speakers shift to other languages 
that afford the possibility to participate in larger and more 
influential speech The semantic study of meaning assumes that meaning 
is in a relation between signs and meanings that are 
firmly established through social convention However semantics does not study 
the way in which social conventions are made and affect 
language Rather when studying the way in which words and 
signs are used it is often the case that words 
have different meanings depending on the social context of use 
An important example of this is the process called a 
which describes the way in which certain words refer to 
entities through their relation between a specific point in time 
and space when the word is uttered Such words are 
for example the word I which designates the person speaking 
now which designates the moment of speaking and here which 
designates the position of speaking Signs also change their meanings 
over time as the conventions governing their usage gradually change 
The study of how the meaning of linguistic expressions changes 
depending on context is called pragmatics Deixis is an important 
part of the way that we use language to point 
out entities in the Pragmatics is concerned with the ways 
in which language use is patterned and how these patterns 
contribute to meaning For example in all languages linguistic expressions 
can be used not just to transmit information but to 
perform actions Certain actions are made only through language but 
nonetheless have tangible effects eg the act of naming which 
creates a new name for some entity or the act 
of pronouncing someone man and wife which creates a social 
contract of marriage These types of acts are called a 
although they can also be carried out through writing or 
hand The form of linguistic expression often does not correspond 
to the meaning that it actually has in a social 
context For example if at a dinner table a person 
asks Can you reach the that is in fact not 
a question about the length of the arms of the 
one being addressed but a request to pass the salt 
across the table This meaning is implied by the context 
in which it is these kinds of effects of meaning 
are called a These social rules for which ways of 
using language are considered appropriate in certain situations and how 
utterances are to be understood in relation to their context 
vary between communities and learning them is a large part 
of acquiring a in a All healthy a development human 
beings learn to use language Children acquire the language or 
languages used around whichever languages they receive sufficient exposure to 
during childhood The development is essentially the same for children 
acquiring a or a This learning process is referred to 
as acquisition since unlike many other kinds of learning it 
requires no direct teaching or specialized study In ia Descent 
of Man and Selection in Relation to Descent of naturalist 
a called this process an instinctive tendency to acquire an 
First language acquisition proceeds in a fairly regular sequence though 
there is a wide degree of variation in the timing 
of particular stages among normally developing infants From birth newborns 
respond more readily to human speech than to other sounds 
Around one month of age babies appear to be able 
to distinguish between different a Around six months of age 
a child will begin a producing the speech sounds or 
a of the languages used around them Words appear around 
the age of to the average a of an child 
is around a A first a are a literally utterances 
that use just one word to communicate some idea Several 
months after a child begins producing words he or she 
will produce two-word utterances and within a few more months 
will begin to produce a or short sentences that are 
less a complex than adult speech but that do show 
regular syntactic structure From roughly the age of three to 
five years a ability to speak or sign is refined 
to the point that it resembles adult Studies published in 
have indicated that unborn a are capable of language acquisition 
to some Acquisition of second and additional languages can come 
at any age through exposure in daily life or courses 
Children learning a second language are more likely to achieve 
fluency than adults but in general it is very rare 
for someone speaking a second language to pass completely for 
a native speaker An important difference between first language acquisition 
and additional language acquisition is that the process of additional 
language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner already 
Languages understood as the particular set of speech norms of 
a particular community are also a part of the larger 
culture of the community that speaks them Languages differ not 
only in pronunciation vocabulary and grammar but also through having 
different cultures of speaking Humans use language as a way 
of signalling identity with one cultural group as well as 
difference from others Even among speakers of one language several 
different ways of using the language exist and each is 
used to signal affiliation with particular subgroups within a larger 
culture Linguists and anthropologists particularly a a and a have 
specialized in studying how ways of speaking vary between a 
Linguists use the term a to refer to the different 
ways of speaking a language This term includes geographically or 
socioculturally defined a as well as the a or a 
of a Linguistic anthropologists and sociologists of language define communicative 
style as the ways that language is used and understood 
within a particular Because norms for language use are shared 
by members of a specific group communicative style also becomes 
a way of displaying and constructing group identity Linguistic differences 
may become salient markers of divisions between social groups for 
example speaking a language with a particular accent may imply 
membership of an ethnic minority or social class one's area 
of origin or status as a second language speaker These 
kinds of differences are not part of the linguistic system 
but are an important part of how people use language 
as a social tool for constructing However many languages also 
have grammatical conventions that signal the social position of the 
speaker in relation to others through the use of registers 
that are related to social hierarchies or divisions In many 
languages there are stylistic or even grammatical differences between the 
ways men and women speak between age groups or between 
a just as some languages employ different words depending on 
who is listening For example in the Australian language a 
a married man must use a special set of words 
to refer to everyday items when speaking in the presence 
of his Some cultures for example have elaborate systems of 
social a or systems of signalling social distance through linguistic 
In English social deixis is shown mostly through distinguishing between 
addressing some people by first name and others by surname 
and in titles such as Mrs boy Doctor or Your 
Honor but in other languages such systems may be highly 
complex and codified in the entire grammar and vocabulary of 
the language For instance in languages of east Asia such 
as a a and a different words are used according 
to whether a speaker is addressing someone of higher or 
lower rank than oneself in a ranking system with animals 
and children ranking the lowest and gods and members of 
royalty as the Throughout history a number of different ways 
of representing language in graphic media have been invented These 
are called a The use of writing has made language 
even more useful to humans It makes it possible to 
store large amounts of information outside of the human body 
and retrieve it again and it allows communication across distances 
that would otherwise be impossible Many languages conventionally employ different 
genres styles and registers in written and spoken language and 
in some communities writing traditionally takes place in an entirely 
different language than the one spoken There is some evidence 
that the use of writing also has effects on the 
cognitive development of humans perhaps because acquiring literacy generally requires 
explicit and a The invention of the first writing systems 
is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the a in 
the late a millennium millennium The a archaic a and 
the a are generally considered to be the earliest writing 
systems both emerging out of their ancestral symbol systems from 
BC with the earliest coherent texts from about a century 
It is generally agreed that Sumerian writing was an independent 
however it is debated whether Egyptian writing was developed completely 
independently of Sumerian or was a case of a A 
similar debate exists for the a which developed around BC 
The a a writing writing including among others a and 
a are generally believed to have had independent All languages 
change as speakers adopt or invent new ways of speaking 
and pass them on to other members of their speech 
community Language change happens at all levels from the phonological 
level to the levels of vocabulary morphology syntax and discourse 
Even though language change is often initially evaluated negatively by 
speakers of the language who often consider changes to be 
decay or a sign of slipping norms of language usage 
it is natural and Changes may affect specific sounds or 
the entire a a can consist of the replacement of 
one speech sound or a by another the complete loss 
of the affected sound or even the introduction of a 
new sound in a place where there had been none 
Sound changes can be in which case a sound is 
changed only if it occurs in the vicinity of certain 
other sounds Sound change is usually assumed to be which 
means that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its 
structural conditions are met irrespective of any factors On the 
other hand sound changes can sometimes be affecting only one 
particular word or a few words without any seeming regularity 
Sometimes a simple change triggers a a in which the 
entire phonological system is affected This happened in the a 
when the sound change known as a affected all the 
stop consonants in the system The original consonant language became 
b in the Germanic languages the previous language in turn 
became p and the previous language became f The same 
process applied to all stop consonants and explains why a 
such as Latin have ipi in words like and whereas 
Germanic languages like English have and Another example is the 
a Vowel Vowel in English which is the reason that 
the spelling of English vowels do not correspond well to 
their current pronunciation This is because the vowel shift brought 
the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation Another 
source of sound change is the erosion of words as 
pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words leaving out 
syllables or sounds This kind of change caused Latin to 
eventually become the a and American English Change also happens 
in the grammar of languages as discourse patterns such as 
a or particular constructions become a This frequently happens when 
words or morphemes erode and the grammatical system is unconsciously 
rearranged to compensate for the lost element For example in 
some varieties of a the final s has eroded away 
Since a uses final s in the morpheme marking the 
a persona subject you in verbs the Caribbean varieties now 
have to express the second person using the pronoun This 
means that the sentence what's your name is te span 
in the International Phonetic Alphabet IPA te in Standard Spanish 
but span in the International Phonetic Alphabet IPA te in 
Caribbean Spanish The simple sound change has affected both morphology 
and Another common cause of grammatical change is the gradual 
petrification of idioms into new grammatical forms for example the 
way the English going to construction lost its aspect of 
movement and in some varieties of English has almost become 
a full-fledged future tense eg Language change may be motivated 
by language internal factors such as changes in pronunciation motivated 
by certain sounds being difficult to distinguish aurally or to 
produce or through patterns of change that cause some rare 
types of constructions to a towards more common Other causes 
of language change are social such as when certain pronunciations 
become emblematic of membership in certain groups such as social 
classes or with a and therefore are adopted by those 
who wish to identify with those groups or ideas In 
this way issues of identity and politics can have profound 
effects on language One important source of language change is 
contact and resulting a of linguistic traits between languages Language 
contact occurs when speakers of two or more languages or 
a interact on a regular a is likely to have 
been the norm throughout a and most people in the 
modern world are multilingual Before the rise of the concept 
of the a was characteristic mainly of populations inhabiting small 
islands But with the ideology that made one people one 
state and one language the most desirable political arrangement started 
to spread throughout the world Nonetheless there are only countries 
in the world corresponding to some languages which means that 
most countries are multilingual and most languages therefore exist in 
close contact with other When speakers of different languages interact 
closely it is typical for their languages to influence each 
other Through sustained language contact over long periods linguistic traits 
diffuse between languages and languages belonging to different families may 
converge to become more similar In areas where many languages 
are in close contact this may lead to the formation 
of a in which unrelated languages share a number of 
linguistic features A number of such language areas have been 
documented among them the a language language the a language 
language and the a language language Also larger areas such 
as a Europe and Southeast Asia have sometimes been considered 
language areas because of widespread diffusion of specific a feature 
Language contact may also lead to a variety of other 
linguistic phenomena including a a and a replacement of much 
of the native vocabulary with that of another language In 
situations of extreme and sustained language contact it may lead 
to the formation of new a that cannot be considered 
to belong to a single language family One type of 
mixed language called a occurs when adult speakers of two 
different languages interact on a regular basis but in a 
situation where neither group learns to speak the language of 
the other group fluently In such a case they will 
often construct a communication form that has traits of both 
languages but which has a simplified grammatical and phonological structure 
The language comes to contain mostly the grammatical and phonological 
categories that exist in both languages Pidgin languages are defined 
by not having any native speakers but only being spoken 
by people who have another language as their first language 
But if a Pidgin language becomes the main language of 
a speech community then eventually children will grow up learning 
the pidgin as their first language As the generation of 
child learners grow up the pidgin will often be seen 
to change its structure and acquire a greater degree of 
complexity This type of language is generally called a a 
An example of such mixed languages is a the official 
language of a which originally arose as a Pidgin based 
on English and a others are a the creole language 
spoken in a and a a mixed language of Canada 
based on the Native American language a and ia defines 
a living language as one that has at least one

is no a or between a language and a a

language is a dialect with an army and language is

frequently override linguistic difference in determining whether two linguistic varieties

are more different from each other than a is from

a single language with two normative variants but due to 
sociopolitical reasons a and a are now often treated as

on cultural differences distinctive a or degree of a The 
world's languages can be grouped into a consisting of languages 
that can be shown to have common ancestry Linguists recognize 
many hundreds of language families although some of them can
