from the a Greek span of Ancient is the systematic 
study of the a of a a and the most 
general laws of a A valid inference is one where 
there is a specific relation of logical support between the 
assumptions of the inference and its a In ordinary discourse 
inferences may be signified by words such as and so 
on There is no universal agreement as to the exact 
scope and subject matter of logic see a below but 
it has traditionally included the classification of arguments the systematic 
exposition of the common to all valid arguments the study 
of proof and a including a and a and the 
study of a and a Historically logic has been studied 
in a since ancient times and a since the century 
and recently logic has been studied in a a a 
and other fields The concept of a forma is central 
to logic The validity of an argument is determined by 
its logical form not by its content Traditional a syllogistic 
and modern symbolic logic are examples of formal logic However 
agreement on what logic is has remained elusive although the 
field of a has studied the common structure of logics 
Logic is generally considered when it analyzes and represents the 
of any valid argument type The form of an argument 
is displayed by representing its sentences in the formal grammar 
and symbolism of a logical language to make its content 
usable in formal inference Simply put to formalize simply means 
to translate English sentences into the language of logic This 
is called showing the of the argument It is necessary 
because indicative sentences of ordinary language show a considerable variety 
of form and complexity that makes their use in inference 
impractical It requires first ignoring those grammatical features irrelevant to 
logic such as gender and declension if the argument is 
in Latin replacing conjunctions irrelevant to logic such as but 
with a like and and replacing ambiguous or alternative logical 
expressions any every etc with expressions of a standard type 
such as all or the a Second certain parts of 
the sentence must be replaced with schematic letters Thus for 
example the expression all Ps are Qs shows the logical 
form common to the sentences all men are mortals all 
cats are carnivores all Greeks are philosophers and so on 
The schema can further be condensed into the a where 
the letter indicates the judgement are The importance of form 
was recognised from ancient times Aristotle uses variable letters to 
represent valid inferences in ia leading a to say that 
the introduction of variables was one of greatest According to 
the followers of Aristotle such as a only the logical 
principles stated in schematic terms belong to logic not those 
given in concrete terms The concrete terms man mortal etc 
are analogous to the substitution values of the schematic iPi 
iRi which were called the matter Greek of the inference 
There is a big difference between the kinds of formulas 
seen in traditional term logic and the a that is 
the fundamental advance of modern logic The formula all Ps 
are Qs of traditional logic corresponds to the more complex 
formula span The validity of an argument depends upon the 
meaning or of the sentences that make it up a 
especially ia gives a cursory outline of semantics which the 
a particularly in the thirteenth and fourteenth century developed into 
a complex and sophisticated theory called a This showed how 
the truth of simple sentences expressed schematically depend on how 
the terms or certain items For example in part II 
of his a of a of of presents a comprehensive 
account of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the truth 
of simple sentences in order to show which arguments are 
valid and which are not Thus every A is is 
true if and only if there is something for which 
stands and there is nothing for which stands for which 
does not also Early modern logic defined semantics purely as 
a relation between ideas a in the a Royal Royal 
says that conceiving things by our ideas we compare these 
ideas and finding that some belong together and some do 
not we unite or separate them This is called or 
and in general Thus truth and falsity are no more 
than the agreement or disagreement of ideas This suggests obvious 
difficulties leading a to distinguish between truth when our ideas 
have and or truth where ideas like harpies or centaurs 
exist only in the This view a was taken to 
the extreme in the nineteenth century and is generally held 
by modern logicians to signify a low point in the 
decline of logic before the twentieth century Modern semantics is 
in some ways closer to the medieval view in rejecting 
such psychological However the introduction of a needed to solve 
the a of multiple of multiple rendered impossible the kind 
of analysis that underlies medieval semantics The main modern approach 
is based on a a theory of theory of The 
approach assumes that the meaning of the various parts of 
the propositions are given by the possible ways we can 
give a recursively specified group of a from them to 
some predefined a of of an interpretation of a predicate 
predicate is given by a mapping from terms to a 
universe of a and a mapping from propositions to the 
truth values true and semantics is one of the fundamental 
concepts of a Modern semantics also admits rival approaches such 
as the a that associates the meaning of propositions with 
the roles that they can play in inferences an approach 
that ultimately derives from the work of a on a 
proof proof and is heavily influenced by a later philosophy 
especially his aphorism meaning is use is not to be 
confused with An implication is a sentence of the form 
p then and can be true or a Stoic a 
the of was the first to define the truth conditions 
of such an only when the antecedent p is true 
and the consequent q is in all other cases true 
An inference on the other hand consists of two separately 
asserted propositions of the form therefore An inference is not 
true or but valid or invalid However there is a 
connection between implication and inference as if the implication p 
then is the inference therefore is This was given an 
apparently paradoxical formulation by Philo who said that the implication 
it is day it is is true only at night 
so the inference is day therefore it is is valid 
in the night but not in the day The theory 
of inference or was systematically developed in medieval times by 
logicians such as a of of and a It is 
uniquely medieval though it has its origins in a and 
a iDe This is why many terms in logic are 
Latin For example the rule that licenses the move from 
the implication p then plus the assertion of its antecedent 
p to the assertion of the consequent q is known 
as a or of Its Latin formulation is The Latin 
formulations of many other rules such as anything follows from 
a falsehood ad disproof by showing the consequence is absurd 
also date from this period However the theory of consequences 
or of the so-called was never fully integrated into the 
theory of the This was partly because of the resistance 
to reducing the categorical judgment S is to the so-called 
hypothetical judgment anything is S it is The first was 
thought to imply S is the second was not and 
as late as in the a article on Logic we 
find the Oxford logician TH Case arguing against and modern 
analysis of the universal proposition A formal system is an 
organization of terms used for the analysis of deduction It 
consists of an alphabet a language over the alphabet to 
construct sentences and a rule for deriving sentences Among the 
important properties that a can have Some logical systems do 
not have all four properties As an example a a 
incompleteness show that sufficiently complex formal systems of arithmetic cannot 
be consistent and however predicate logics not extended by specific 
a to be arithmetic formal systems with equality can be 
complete and As the study of argument is of clear 
importance to the reasons that we hold things to be 
true logic is of essential importance to a Here we 
have defined logic to be the systematic study of the 
form of the reasoning behind argument is of several sorts 
but only some of these arguments fall under the aegis 
of logic proper a concerns the a of given premises 
and is the form of reasoning most closely connected to 
logic On a narrow conception of logic see below logic 
concerns just deductive reasoning although such a narrow conception controversially 
excludes most of what is called informal logic from the 
discipline There are other forms of reasoning that are rational 
but that are generally not taken to be part of 
logic These include a which covers forms of inference that 
move from collections of particular judgements to universal judgements and 
a which is a form of inference that goes from 
observation to a hypothesis that accounts for the reliable data 
observation and seeks to explain relevant evidence The American philosopher 
a Sanders Sanders first introduced the term as Peirce said 
that to a hypothetical explanation span While inductive and inference 
are not part of logic proper the methodology of logic 
has been applied to them with some degree of success 
For example the notion of deductive validity where an inference 
is deductively valid a and only and only there is 
no possible situation in which all the premises are true 
but the conclusion exists in an analogy to the notion 
of inductive validity or strength where an inference is inductively 
strong if and only if its premises give some degree 
of probability to its conclusion Whereas the notion of deductive 
validity can be rigorously stated for systems of formal logic 
in terms of the well-understood notions of a inductive validity 
requires us to define a reliable generalization of some set 
of observations The task of providing this definition may be 
approached in various ways some less formal than some of 
these definitions may use logical association a while others may 
use a of probability such as a Logic arose see 
below from a concern with correctness of a Modern logicians 
usually wish to ensure that logic studies just those arguments 
that arise from appropriately general forms of inference For example 
Thomas writes in the ia Encyclopedia of Encyclopedia of that 
logic does not however cover good reasoning as a whole 
That is the job of the theory of a Rather 
it deals with inferences whose validity can be traced back 
to the formal features of the representations that are involved 
in that inference be they linguistic mental or other Logic 
has been of to material near this tag may use 
weasel words or attribution September as the study of arguments 
correct in virtue of their form This has not been 
the definition taken in this article but the idea that 
logic treats special forms of argument deductive argument rather than 
argument in general has a history in logic that dates 
back at least to a in mathematics and centuries and 
the advent of the influence of mathematical logic on philosophy 
A consequence of taking logic to treat special kinds of 
argument is that it leads to identification of special kinds 
of truth the logical truths with logic equivalently being the 
study of logical truth and excludes many of the original 
objects of study of logic that are treated as informal 
logic a has argued against the idea that logic is 
the study of a special kind of logical truth arguing 
that instead one can talk of the logic of a 
in the terminology of a with logic making explicit the 
commitments that were originally implicit in informal citation requires a 
reference to the specific page or range of pages in 
which the material appears September Logic comes from the Greek 
word originally meaning the word or what is spoken but 
coming to mean thought or reason In the Western World 
logic was first developed by a who called the subject

in wide use in the West until the early system 
of logic was responsible for the introduction of a a

were made to show that ideas were compatible with a

focus of philosophers who would engage in critical logical analyses

and fallen out of favour as depicted in a satirical 
play ia In India the a school of logic was 
founded by a c 6th century Innovations in the scholastic 
school called a continued from ancient times into the early 
with the a school By the it developed theories resembling 
modern logic such as a distinction between sense and reference 
of proper names and his definition of number as well 
as the theory of restrictive conditions for universals anticipating some 
of the developments in modern a Since Indian logic attracted 
the attention of many Western scholars and has had an 
influence on important logicians such as a a De De 
Morgana and a In the Western philosophers like Stanislaw and 
Klaus have explored Indian logic more extensively The a logic 
developed by Aristotle predominated in the West until the when 
interest in the a of of stimulated the development of 
symbolic logic now called a In George Boole published ia 
Laws of Investigation of the Laws of Thought on Which 
are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and introducing symbolic 
logic and the principles of what is now known as 
a In Frege published ia which inaugurated modern logic with 
the invention of a notation reconciling the Aristotelian and Stoic 
logics in a broader system and solving such problems for 
which Aristotelian logic was impotent such as the a of 
multiple of multiple From to a North North and a 
published ia on the foundations of mathematics attempting to derive 
mathematical truths from a and a in symbolic logic In 
a raised serious problems with the program and logic ceased 
to focus on such issues The development of logic since 
Frege Russell and a had a profound influence on the 
practice of philosophy and the perceived nature of philosophical problems

is implemented in computer a and is fundamental to a 
Logic is commonly taught by university philosophy departments often as 
a compulsory discipline The ia was a body of work 
on logic with the ia constituting the first explicit work 
in formal logic introducing the The parts of syllogistic logic 
also known by the name a are the analysis of 
the judgements into propositions consisting of two terms that are 
related by one of a fixed number of relations and 
the expression of inferences by means of a that consist 
of two propositions sharing a common term as premise and 
a conclusion that is a proposition involving the two unrelated 
terms from the premises work was regarded in classical times 
and from medieval times in Europe and the Middle East 
as the very picture of a fully worked out system 
However it was not the a proposed a system of 
a that was studied by medieval logicians Also the a 
of multiple of multiple was recognized in medieval times Nonetheless 
problems with syllogistic logic were not seen as being in 
need of revolutionary solutions Today some academics claim that system 
is generally seen as having little more than historical value 
though there is some current interest in extending term logics 
regarded as made obsolete by the advent of propositional logic 
and the a Others use Aristotle in a to help 
develop and critically question argumentation schemes that are used in 
a and a arguments I was upset I had always 
believed logic was a universal weapon and now I realized 
how its validity depended on the way it was A 
propositional calculus or logic also a sentential calculus is a 
formal system in which formulae representing propositions can be formed 
by combining a using a and in which a system 
of formal proof rules establishes certain formulae as theorems An 
example of a theorem of propositional logic is span Predicate 
logic is the generic term for symbolic formal systems such 
as a a a and a It provides an account 
of a general enough to express a wide set of 
arguments occurring in natural language For example a famous a 
there is a man who shaves all and only men 
who do not shave themselves can be formalised by the 
sentence span Whilst Aristotelian syllogistic logic specifies a small number 
of forms that the relevant part of the involved judgements 
may take predicate logic allows sentences to be analysed into 
subject and argument in several additional predicate logic to solve 
the a of multiple of multiple that had perplexed medieval 
logicians The development of predicate logic is usually attributed to 
a who is also credited as one of the founders 
of a but the formulation of predicate logic most often 
used today is the logic presented in a of Mathematical 
of Mathematical by a and a in The analytical generality 
of predicate logic allowed the formalization of mathematics drove the 
investigation of a and allowed the development of a approach 
to a It provides the foundation of modern a original 
system of predicate logic was rather than a is most 
prominently defended against the criticism of a Van Orman Van 
Orman and others by a and a claim needs references 
to reliable sources April In languages a deals with the 
phenomenon that of a sentence may have their semantics modified 
by special verbs or modal particles For example go to 
the can be modified to give should go to the 
and can go to the and perhaps will go to 
the More abstractly we might say that modality affects the 
circumstances in which we take an assertion to be satisfied 
Confusing modality is known as the a a logic is 
in large parts concerned with the theory of logic Although 
there are passages in his work such as the famous 
a of future argumenta in ia that are now seen 
as anticipations of modal logic and its connection with a 
and time the earliest formal system of modal logic was 
developed by a who ultimately developed a theory of a 
a While the study of necessity and possibility remained important 
to philosophers little logical innovation happened until the landmark investigations 
of a Irving Irving in who formulated a family of 
rival axiomatizations of the alethic modalities His work unleashed a 
torrent of new work on the topic expanding the kinds 
of modality treated to include a and a The seminal 
work of a applied the same formal language to treat 
a and paved the way for the marriage of the 
two subjects a discovered contemporaneously with rivals his theory of 
a which revolutionized the formal technology available to modal logicians 
and gave a new a way of looking at modality 
that has driven many applications in a and a such 
as a logic modal The motivation for the study of 
logic in ancient times was it is so that one 
may learn to distinguish good arguments from bad arguments and 
so become more effective in argument and oratory and perhaps 
also to become a better person Half of the works 
of a treat inference as it occurs in an informal 
setting side by side with the development of the syllogistic 
and in the Aristotelian school these informal works on logic 
were seen as complementary to treatment of a This ancient 
motivation is still alive although it no longer takes centre 
stage in the picture of typically a logic forms the 
heart of a course in a a compulsory course at 
many universities Dialectic has been linked to logic since ancient 
times but it has not been until recent decades that 
European and American logicians have attempted to provide mathematical foundations 
for logic and dialectic by formalising dialectical logic a is 
also the name given to the special treatment of dialectic 
in a and a thought There have been treatises on 
argument and dialectic from authors such as a Uses of 
a and van and a Theories of a can provide 
a foundation for the formalisation of dialectical logic and dialectic 
itself can be formalised as moves in a game where 
an advocate for the truth of a proposition and an 
opponent argue Such games can provide a formal a for 
many logics a is the study and research of informal 
logic fallacies and critical questions as they relate to every 
day and practical situations Specific types of dialogue can be 
analyzed and questioned to reveal premises conclusions and fallacies Argumentation 
theory is now applied in a and a Mathematical logic 
comprises two distinct areas of the first is the application 
of the techniques of formal logic to mathematics and mathematical 
reasoning and the second in the other direction the application 
of mathematical techniques to the representation and analysis of formal 
The earliest use of mathematics and a in relation to 
logic and philosophy goes back to the ancient Greeks such 
as a a and a Many other ancient and medieval 
philosophers applied mathematical ideas and methods to their philosophical One 
of the boldest attempts to apply logic to mathematics was 
the a pioneered by such as a and a Mathematical 
theories were supposed to be logical a and the programme 
was to show this by means of a reduction of 
mathematics to The various attempts to carry this out met 
with failure from the crippling of project in his by 
a to the defeat of a by a incompleteness incompleteness 
Both the statement of program and its refutation by depended 
upon their work establishing the second area of mathematical logic 
the application of mathematics to logic in the form of

mathematics to logic can be understood as showing how close 
logicism came to being every rigorously defined mathematical theory can 
be exactly captured by a logical a is enough to 
the whole of mathematics though not to it If proof 
theory and model theory have been the foundation of mathematical 
logic they have been but two of the four pillars 
of the a originated in the study of the infinite 
by a and it has been the source of many 
of the most challenging and important issues in mathematical logic

the modern debate on a axioms a captures the idea 
of computation in logical and a its most classical achievements 
are the of the a by a and his presentation 
of the a Today recursion theory is mostly concerned with 
the more refined problem of a is a problem efficiently 
the classification of a of a deals with formal descriptions 
of ordinary a that is strictly only about the arguments 
within philosophy's other branches Most philosophers assume that the bulk 
of everyday reasoning can be captured in logic if a 
method or methods to translate ordinary language into that logic 
can be found Philosophical logic is essentially a continuation of 
the traditional discipline called logic before the invention of mathematical 
logic Philosophical logic has a much greater concern with the 
connection between natural language and logic As a result philosophical 
logicians have contributed a great deal to the development of 
logics eg a a as well as various extensions of 
a eg a and semantics for such logics eg a 
a in the semantics of logic Logic and the philosophy 
of language are closely related Philosophy of language has to 
do with the study of how our language engages and 
interacts with our thinking Logic has an immediate impact on 
other areas of study Studying logic and the relationship between 
logic and ordinary speech can help a person better structure 
his own arguments and critique the arguments of others Many 
popular arguments are filled with errors because so many people 
are untrained in logic and unaware of how to formulate 
an argument Logic cut to the heart of computer science 
as it emerged as a a work on the ia 
followed from a work on the a The notion of 
the general purpose computer that came from this work was 
of fundamental importance to the designers of the computer machinery 
in the In the and researchers predicted that when human 
knowledge could be expressed using logic with a it would 
be possible to create a machine that reasons or artificial 
intelligence This was more difficult than expected because of the 
complexity of human reasoning In a a program consists of 
a set of axioms and rules Logic programming systems such 
as a compute the consequences of the axioms and rules 
in order to answer a query Today logic is extensively 
applied in the fields of a and a and these 
fields provide a rich source of problems in formal and 
informal logic a is one good example of how logic 
is being applied to artificial intelligence The a Computing Classification 
Computing Classification in particular Furthermore computers can be used as 
tools for logicians For example in symbolic logic and mathematical 
logic proofs by humans can be Using a theorem theorem 
the machines can find and check proofs as well as 
work with proofs too lengthy to write out by hand 
The logics discussed above are all a of or that

rules of a Hegel developed his own a that extended 
a transcendental logic but also brought it back to ground

logic is of great interest to computer scientists as it

it has often been proposed as a logic However modal 
logic is normally formalized with the principle of the excluded

What sort of argument is appropriate for criticizing purported principles 
of In an influential paper entitled a Logic Logic a 
building on a suggestion of a V V argued that 
in general the facts of propositional logic have a similar 
epistemological status as facts about the physical universe for example 
as the laws of a or of a and in 
particular that what physicists have learned about quantum mechanics provides 
a compelling case for abandoning certain familiar principles of classical 
if we want to be a about the physical phenomena 
described by quantum theory then we should abandon the a 
of of substituting for classical logic the a proposed by 
a and a von von Another paper of the same 
name by a argues that desire for realism mandates the 
law of Distributivity of logic is essential for the realist's 
understanding of how propositions are true of the world in 
just the same way as he has argued the principle 
of bivalence is In this way the question Is Logic 
can be seen to lead naturally into the fundamental controversy 
in a on a versus versus The notion of implication 
formalized in classical logic does not comfortably translate into natural 
language by means of due to a number of problems 
called the a of material of material The first class 
of paradoxes involves such as the moon is made of 
green cheese then which are puzzling because natural language does 
not support the a of of Eliminating this class of 
paradoxes was the reason for a formulation of a which 
eventually led to more radically revisionist logics such as a 
The second class of paradoxes involves redundant premises falsely suggesting 
that we know the succedent because of the thus if 
that man gets elected granny will die is materially true 
since granny is mortal regardless of the man's election prospects 
Such sentences violate the a maxima of relevance and can 
be modelled by logics that reject the principle of a 
of of such as relevance logic a was deeply critical 
of any simplified notion of the a of of It 
was based on a Wilhelm Wilhelm idea that this law 
of logic also requires a sufficient ground to specify from 
what point of view or time one says that something 
cannot contradict itself A building for example both moves and 
does not the ground for the first is our solar 
system and for the second the earth In Hegelian dialectic 
the law of non-contradiction of identity itself relies upon difference 
and so is not independently assertable Closely related to questions 
arising from the paradoxes of implication comes the suggestion that 
logic ought to tolerate a a and a are the 
most important approaches here though the concerns are a key 
consequence of a and some of its rivals such as 
a is that they respect the a of of which 
means that the logic collapses if it is capable of 
deriving a contradiction a the main proponent of a has 
argued for on the grounds that there are in fact 
true text near this tag may need clarification or removal 
of jargon October The philosophical vein of various kinds of 
skepticism contains many kinds of doubt and rejection of the 
various bases on which logic rests such as the idea 
of logical form correct inference or meaning typically leading to 
the conclusion that there are no a This is in 
contrast with the usual views in a where logic directs 
skeptical enquiry to doubt received wisdoms as in the work 
of a a provides a strong example of the rejection 
of the usual basis of his radical rejection of idealization 
led him to reject truth as a army of metaphors 
metonyms and metaphors which are worn out and without sensuous 
coins which have lost their pictures and now matter only 
as metal no longer as His rejection of truth did 
not lead him to reject the idea of either inference 
or logic completely but rather suggested that logic into existence 
in man's head of illogic whose realm originally must have 
been immense Innumerable beings who made inferences in a way 
different from ours Thus there is the idea that logical 
inference has a use as a tool for human survival 
but that its existence does not support the existence of 
truth nor does it have a reality beyond the Logic 
too also rests on assumptions that do not correspond to 
anything in the real This position held by Nietzsche however 
has come under extreme scrutiny for several reasons Some philosophers 
such as a claim his position is accuse Nietzsche of 
not even having a coherent perspective let alone a theory
