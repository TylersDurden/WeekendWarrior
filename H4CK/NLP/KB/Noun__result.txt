Art of Art of attributed to a 2nd century BC 
The term used in a was All of these terms 
for noun were also words meaning The English word is 
derived from the Latin term through the a The word 
classes were defined partly by the grammatical a that they 
take In Sanskrit Greek and Latin for example nouns are 
categorized by a and inflected for a and a Because 
a share these three a adjectives are placed in the 
same class as Similarly the Latin includes both nouns substantives 
and adjectives as originally did the English word the two 
types being distinguished as and or and or short and 
The word ia is now sometimes used to denote a 
class that includes both nouns and adjectives Many European languages 
use a a of the word as the basic term 
for noun for example Spanish ia noun Nouns in the 
dictionaries of such languages are demarked by the abbreviation isi 
or instead of which may be used for proper nouns 
or neuter nouns instead In English some modern authors use 
the word to refer to a class that includes both 
nouns single words and a multiword units also called noun 
It can also be used as a counterpart to when 
distinguishing between a noun being used as the a main 
word of a noun phrase and a noun being used 
as a a For example the noun can be said 
to be used substantively in knee but attributively in patient 
needed knee Nouns have sometimes been defined in terms of 
the grammatical categories to which they are subject classed by 
gender inflected for case and number Such definitions tend to 
be since nouns do not have the same categories in 
all languages Nouns are frequently defined particularly in informal contexts 
in terms of their a properties their meanings Nouns are 
described as words that refer to a etc However this 
type of definition has been criticized by contemporary linguists as 
being There have been offered several examples of nouns which 
do not have any ia as found in ion behalf 
ia iin dint and ia the sake Moreover there may 
be a relationship similar to reference in the case of 
other parts of the verbs ito or ito many adjectives 
like and there is little difference between the adverb and 
the phrase There are placeholder names such as the a 
ia whose existence is not in question an experimental ia 
or a such as ia a often prefer to define 
nouns and other lexical categories in terms of their formal 
properties These include a information such as what a or 
a they take and also their a how they combine 
with other words and expressions of particular types Such definitions 
may nonetheless still be since syntax as well as morphology 
varies between languages For example in English it might be 
noted that nouns are words that can with definite articles 
as stated at the start of this article but this 
would not apply in a which has no definite articles 
There have been several attempts sometimes controversial to produce a 
stricter definition of nouns on a semantic basis Some of 
these are referenced in the a section below In some 
languages genders are assigned to nouns such as masculine feminine 
and neuter The gender of a noun as well as 
its number and case where applicable will often entail a 
in words that modify or are related to it For 
example in a the singular form of the definite article 
is with masculine nouns and with adjectives and certain verb 
forms also change with the addition of span with feminines 
Grammatical gender often correlates with the form of the noun 
and the inflection pattern it for example in both a 
and a most nouns ending span are feminine Gender can 
also correlate with the a of the noun's referent particularly 
in the case of nouns denoting people and sometimes animals 
Nouns arguably do not have gender in Modern English although 
many of them denote people or animals of a specific 
sex or and pronouns that refer to nouns must take 
the appropriate gender for that noun The lost spectacles A 
or is a noun representing unique entities such as ia 
ia ia ia or ia as distinguished from common nouns 
which describe a class of entities such as or or 
are common nouns that can take a a can combine 
with a or counting a eg and can take an 
indefinite article such as or in languages which have such 
articles Examples of count nouns are and or or differ 
from count nouns in precisely that they cannot take plurals 
or combine with number words or the above type of 
quantifiers For example it is not possible to refer to 
ia or This is true even though the pieces of 
furniture comprising could be counted Thus the distinction between mass 
and count nouns should not be made in terms of 
what sorts of things the nouns refer to but rather 
in terms of how the nouns these Many nouns have 
both countable and uncountable for example is countable in give 
me three sodas but uncountable in he likes soda are 
nouns that even when they are inflected for the a 
refer to consisting of more than one individual or entity 
Examples include and In English these nouns may be followed 
by a singular or a plural verb and referred to 
by a singular or plural pronoun the singular being generally 
preferred when referring to the body as a unit and 
the plural often being preferred especially in British English when 
emphasizing the individual Examples of acceptable and unacceptable use given 
by in refer to a that can in principle at 
least iie different schools of philosophy and sciences may question 
the assumption but for the most part people agree to 
the existence of something Eg a rock a tree be 
observed by at least one of the a for instance 
or on the other hand refer to a that is 
ideas or concepts such as or While this distinction is 
sometimes exclusive some nouns have multiple senses including both concrete 
and abstract consider for example the noun which usually refers 
to a concept eg is an important element of human 
but which can refer to a specific artwork in certain 
contexts eg iI put my art up on the Some 
abstract nouns developed etymologically by figurative extension from literal roots 
These include and Similarly some nouns have both abstract and 
concrete senses with the latter having developed by figurative extension 
from the former These include and In English many abstract 
nouns are formed by adding a suffix to adjectives or 
verbs Examples are from the adjective from the verb and 
from the adjective Some languages refer to nouns differently depending 
on how ownership is being given for the given noun 
This can be broken into two alienable and a An 
alienable noun is something that does not belong to a 
person indefinitely Inalienable nouns on the other hand refer to 
something that is possessed definitely Examples of alienable nouns would 
be a tree or a shirt or roads Examples of 
inalienable nouns would be a father or shadow or hair 
The a uses a distinction between There are several classifier 
The first is for objects which tend to be pretty 
large in size and not being a favorite possession tree 
or shirt and the second is for small controllable favorite 
objects like dogs books or spears A third form would 
be set aside for food objects like bananas oranges or 
fish Drinks like water or coconut liquor also have classifier 
forms A fifth classifier would be designated for things that 
are to be chewed but not fully consumed The only 
example of this was from the book in and the 
fruit pandanus is chewed for the juice but what remains 
after consuming the juice discarded The 6th classifier forms are 
set aside for ways of transportation bikes canoes and boats 
The last two classifiers are designated for land and houses 
A noun phrase is a phrase based on a noun 
pronoun or other word nominal optionally accompanied by modifiers such 
as a and a A noun phrase functions within a 
clause or sentence in a role such as that of 
a a or a of a verb or preposition For 
example in the sentence The black cat sat on a 
dear friend of mine the noun phrase black cati serves 
as the subject and the noun phrase ia dear friend 
of serves as the complement of the preposition ioni Nouns 
and noun phrases can typically be replaced by a such 
as and in order to avoid repetition or explicit identification 
or for other reasons For example in the sentence thought 
that he was the word is a pronoun standing in 
place of the person's name The word can replace parts 
of noun phrases and it sometimes stands in for a 
noun An example is given But can also stand in 
for larger parts of a noun phrase For example in 
the following example can stand in for cari is a 
process whereby a word that belongs to another part of 
speech comes to be used as a noun For definitions 
of nouns based on the concept of identity For more 
on identity For the concept that nouns are prototypically For 
an attempt to relate the concepts of identity criteria and
