# Copying the image to the SD card
  In a terminal window, write the image to the card with the command below, making sure you replace the input file if= argument with the path to your .img file, and the /dev/sdX in the output file of= argument with the correct device name. 

dd bs=4m if=2018-11-13-raspbian-stretch.img of=/dev/sdX conv=fsync
^^ Means do drive with block size 4MB, using raspbian_stretch.img, into /dev/sdX

Or:
sudo dd if=NameOfImageToWrite.img of=/dev/rdiskNUMBER bs=4m
Or:
xzcat kali-$version-rpi2.img.xz | dd of=/dev/sdb bs=512k

# 2 - In - 1 
Although not for the faint of heart, the two operations of unzipping the
raspian image, and writing it to an sd card can be done with one command by 
piping the output of the first, into the second.
